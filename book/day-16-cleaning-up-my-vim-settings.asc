=== Cleaning up my vim settings

So I've customised my vim settings quite a bit based on
https://github.com/astrails/dotvim[astrails dotvim] repository. My changes have
diverged quite abit and I'd rather break them from the branch and start a
fresh. This will lead the way for me stripping down my settings and finding
ways to easily get used to using vim without all the bells and whistles.

The first thing I need to do is detach from the origination repository and make
sure that my changes are kept in place. Once this is done I can then create a
config setting to not use and plugins and use a base set of configuration
settings so that I can start to improve my basic Vim skills. 

I had to go to github and delete the repository. Once deleted I created a new
repository with the same name and push the repository

  git push

I now have a repository that is not forked to astrails. I still need to let my
dotfiles know that the repository is update and has changed so I need to do the
following

  gup

This detached the head of the repository, which is easy enough to fix, as long
as there are no local changes.

  g co master

Now that the repository is up to date all I need to do is update my `dotfiles`
to reflect the changes to the detached repository.

  cd ~
  ga dotvim
  g ci -m 'Update my dotvim files'

Now the repository is up to date and my dotfiles know of the change I've just
made.

Finally I push the change to my dotfiles and everything is all set.
