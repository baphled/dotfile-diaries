This plugins add a few more text objects to my tool chain. This one is more general than the last and deals with
indentation blocks of text.

  ai - an indentation level and line above
  ii - inner indentation
  aI - an indentation level lines below and above

As noted in the documentation `iI` is also available but it is essentially added for completeness. As with other text
objects I'm able to do something with a indent block.

So to delete a everthing within a indentation text object is done as follows: 
  dai

NOTE: The following will only work with my custom surround bindings.

Selecting an indentation text object and move it up three times.

  vai<C-k><C-k><C-k>

and moving it down can be do as so:

  vai<C-j><C-j><C-j>
