==== Setting up Solarize on my Mac

So I've been using the same colour scheme for a while and it's and and all but Solarized seems to be the best,
visually, so I've decided to set up Solarized as my main color scheme.

I'll start this off will setting up my Mac. The settings may be slightly different for *nix based machines but I'll
tackle that in another entry.

For now I'll start with Iterm2. My colour settings are quite basic as you can see from the previous image.

So first off I needed download the iterm solarized color settings and store them in my dotfiles. I stored the settings
in `~/colors/iterm2/solarized_dark.itermcolors`

I then needed to import this into iTerm2.

Once this is complete all that was needed was select the new plugin.

Finally iTerm2 is now setup with Solarized Dark :)
