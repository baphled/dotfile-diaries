=== Syntastic

I use this to help me find syntax errors easily, it doesn't do this on the fly
but I save often enough for that not to be a problem. All that is needed is for
a file to be saved and if any errors are found the quickbox buffer will open up
allowing for me to go over each change and deal with them appropriately.
Syntastic comes with a host of syntax checker and the basic to allow for me to
easily add more checkers dependent on the filetype I am dealing with.

It uses the built in Vim commands for navigation or errors `:lnext` and
`:lprev`. As I'm using unimpaired I have alternative mappings for these as follows:

 * `[l` - `:lnext`
 * `l]` - `:lprevious`

Other mime type related plugins also add their own checkers so I have pretty
much all the checkers I need for the moment. The following languages are
included out of the box. The following is just a few that are maintained that I am interest in:
 * yaml
 * jslint
 * jshint (gillesruppert)
 * sass
 * html (darcyparker)
 * coffee (darcyparker)
 * xml
 * xslt
 * less (irrationalfab)
 * puppet (frimik)
 * ruby
 * scss
 * json
 * cucumber
 * css
 * erlang

There is a range of other checkers that can be found
https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic/tree/master/syntax_checkers[here].

I tend not to use a host of these but at least I know they are there if they
are ever needed.
