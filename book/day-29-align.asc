There are often times when I need to align a range of lines dependant of a given character. A typical use case would be
when I am writing cucumber steps and am using tables. Typically I would have to align each cell manually and keep doing
this each time that a string breaks the current format. This is a pain and it is exactly what Align is used for. It take
the string delimiter I want to base the alignment to and can be prefixed with the range of lines that I want to align.

For example:

  :3,5 Align \s

Which will align the 3rd to 5th lines using the '\s' delimiter.
