Abolish is an interesting plugin created by Time Pope, it is essentially 3 plugins wrapped up into 1 (abbreviation,
substitution, coercion).

We all have problems with our fingers not listening to our brains.  Abbreviation helps us map our common typing mistakes
with what we actually wanted to type. For example I recently had problems type 'editions' and ended up typing 'edtions'
instead.

Stolen from the plugins homepage, the syntax to invoke abbreviation is as follows:

  Abolish {despa,sepe}rat{e,es,ed,ing,ely,ion,ions,or}       {despe,sepa}rat{}


The documentation suggests that I add my abbreviations to '~/.vim/after/plugin/abolish.vim'

Appending a '!' to the command and the abbreviation will be added to '~/.vim/after/plugin/abolish.vim'.

  Abolish! edtion{,s} edition

Abbreviations can also be removed by adding the '--delete' flag as follows:

  Abolish -delete edtion{,s}

We can also search for variants as well as accomplishing complete, this is means we can find a string regardless of its
case and variant which can be quite helpful.

  :Abolish -search edit{s,ion}
  :S edit{s,ion}

Which searches for:
  edit
  edition
  editions

NOTE: This didn't work for me at the time of writing this. Should find out why.

The next part of the plugin is substitution. There are occasions when we need to search and replace a variant of a word
whilst still keeping its case and variation. This could be done via a bundle of substitution commands but this can be
error prone and lead to missed changes which can be tedious.

  :%S/edit{ion,s}/edit/g

Which will change both 'edits' and 'edition' to 'edit'.

Finally there is the CoeRse command. The command is very useful when it comes to coding and when you want to change a
variable names format from one to another. For example when you have the variable 'FilePath' which you want to change to
'file_path'. You simply type `crs` and the variable is now converted to snakecase.

To coerce a variable into another format you simply start off with the 'cr' and append one of the below keys to change
the variables case.

  c: camelCase
  m: MixedCase
  _: snake_case
  s: snake_case
  u: SNAKE_UPPERCASE
  -: dash-case (not reversible)
