=== Setting up irssi

I'm using a Mac and use brew. So it is as easy as running `brew install irssi`.

Job done!

==== Configuring

I like to see all the most important information right in front of me, so my
ideal IRC client looks something like this:

Unconfigured, irssi looks like this:

Which kinda sucks!, where's a list of who is online?

First things first, http://quadpoint.org/articles/irssi/[is a good place to start].

I'll use some tips from there to get myself started.

twirssi - twitter for irc
nicklist - displays a list of users

==== Defaults

Now it's time to tweak our settings so that we can navigate freely and don't
have to decypher what is being said per room. I'm used to having a window per
channel and being alerted when someone makes a comment. For this I'd like to
create a window every time I join a new channel and remove the window once I
have left one. To do this we'll need aliases.

    /SET autocreate_windows ON`
    /SERVER ADD -auto -network freenode irc.freenode.net
    /save
    /exit

This will save us from having to add the FQDN and refer to it as an alias,
freenode in this case.

Now when you restart irssi you will be automatically connected to freenode :)

==== Listing channel users

So to get the user list we'll need nicklist with some tweaks.

The older versions of nicklist require us to use screen/tmux and do some
hackery, I'm not a fan, thankfully I stumbled across this
http://github.com/ConX/nicklist.pl[nicklist.pl]. This isn't ideal, we have
the user list at the top but it's much better than hoping that the screens open
and things fire off at the right time.

That a soon after finding the sweet spot, the original version of the script
decided to kill the cat command you had to run to get the user list, not my
idea of fun.

This will do for the moment but as part of my weekend of hacking I hope to
tweak this script to get the layout I want.

We will need to create a scripts directory for scripts we want to autoload.

    /WINDOW NEW
    /WINDOW NAME hilight
    /WINDOW MOVE up
    /WINDOW SIZE 10
    /WINDOW stick
    /layout save

This will create a new window called 'hilight' which will be displayed at the
top be sticking 10 lines high, which means that it will stay in position
regardless of changing channel windows.

Finally we make sure that our nick is highlighted with `/hilight nick`

We'll leave this for now and come back to tweaking our settings later.
