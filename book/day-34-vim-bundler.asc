==== vim-bundler

Yet another indespensible plugin. I use bundle quite a bit and rather not have to shell out to run `bundle` by itself.

The main use for bundle is to actually call `bundle` to keep my gems up to date and this is done by the following
mapping `:Bundle`.

There is also the functionality to open a gem via `:Bopen` or `:Bsplit` the former will open the gem in the current
buffer where the latter will open it in a new split.
