As with asciidoc I spend sometime adding content to wiki's. The is cool
and all but again I tend to use vim and rather not deal with web
interfaces if I can help it.

Like 'asciidoc-vim', 'vimwiki' handling syntax highlighting but it also
comes with a few key bindings to make easy to pull down wiki pages and
upload them when necessary.

  normal mode: 
  <Leader>ww -- Open default wiki index file.
  <Leader>ws -- Select and open wiki index file.
  <Leader>wd -- Delete wiki file you are in.
  <Leader>wr -- Rename wiki file you are in.
  <Enter> -- Folow/Create wiki link
  <Shift-Enter> -- Split and folow/create wiki link
  <Ctrl-Enter> -- Vertical split and folow/create wiki link
  <Backspace> -- Go back to parent(previous) wiki link
  <Tab> -- Find next wiki link
  <Shift-Tab> -- Find previous wiki link

I don't usually have the need to pull down wiki pages and and make
changes to them persay so I won't spend much time on playing around with
these mappings and could possible turn them off if they end up
conflicting with other key bindings.
