So if you didn't know before, I'm quite a fan of text objects and this is one of those plugins that I have been meaning
to wrap my muscle memory around for a long while.

So the ideal of text objects is that you are able to select a grouping of text easily whilst doing something with it.
The atypical thing to do is the following:

The first puts me in visual mode and highlights everything inside the block
  vir

This does similar to the above but highlights all of the block
  var

It doesn't stop there anything that you can do with a single character, you can do with this and other text objects.
Want to delete everything within a block `dir` deletes the inner ruby block.

The goal for me over the next few days is to play around with these combinations and see what I learn.

NOTE: Once I've gone over my plugin list I'll write more about text objects and what they can do.
