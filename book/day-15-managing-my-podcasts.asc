=== Managing my podcasts

Now is the time that I move my podcasts from iTunes back to the console, where
they belong. I've already installed newsbeuter so I can use that to track the
podcasts I listen to and handling queuing and downloading them.

This is pretty simple really, first off I needed to add a podcasts to my feed
list. I then checkout any new items via newsbeuter which picked up the podcast
and listed it as expected. The next step is to queue up the latest podcast and
listen to it via podbeuter. Pressing `e` enqueues the podcast which will add
the podcast to the queue for downloading. Opening `podbeuter` showed me the
podcast in the queue allowing me to press `a` to start the download.

Here's the changes I needed to get podbeuter to download and listen to my
podcasts.

  download-path       ~/Downloads
  max-downloads       2
  player              afplay

Pressing `p` inside podbeuter actually plays the selected audio file and then
we're away. Podcast management from the command line :).

==== Adding podbeuter to my workflow

As this has been described in previous entries this part is straight forward
and only requires a reference to my `~/tmuxinator/workbench.yml` file. I simply
add a new 'Podcast' window next to my 'Newsfeed' window. Keeping all my
communications close together.
