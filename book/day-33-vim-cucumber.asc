As with all the other content related plugins `vim-cucumber` adds syntax highlighting, mappings and file recognition. It
also lets you know whether their are syntax errors or a step has not been defined. The former is quite useful as it
keeps you focused and allows you to easily work out which steps need to be implemented and which ones have already been
added. As soon as a feature file is saved compilation is started and shortly after, if there are any errors, you will be
alerted via the quick tip buffer.

===== Mappings

There are a few mappings that `vim-cucumber` includes, though they are not actually documented anywhere.

  * `<Ctrl-]>` - Go to the step under the cursor
  * `<Ctrl-W>]` - Open the step under the cursor in a new split buffer
  * `<Ctrl-W><Ctrl-]>` - Same as above
  * `<Ctrl-W>}` - Open associated buffer in a new split buffer
