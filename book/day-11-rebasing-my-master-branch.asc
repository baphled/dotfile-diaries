==== Rebasing my master branch

So it's been a while since I've rebased my changes to the master branch.
I'm relatively happy with the removal of 'braid' so I think it's time to
merge my latest changes into my master branch.

So the first issue I had was that I had problems checking out the master
branch because of the changes to the external repositiories. So I had to
issue the following command:

  git co -f master

This allow me to checkout the master branch and disregard the previous
warnings.

NOTE: Doing this can be a time soak.

I could them do the following to merge my braidless branch into master.

  gup braidless

After this gladly there were no merge conflicts but all of my external
repositiories were deleted.

I basically had to go into each of the external repositiories and
checkout all off the deleted files. This took some time but once it was
comeplete the master branch was happily merged.
