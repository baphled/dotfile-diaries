=== Splitting my workbench

My workbench is starting to get cluttered now and it is becoming increasingly
clear that I have two types of workflow living in the same session. Ideally I'd
like to have my commucation based workflows in a single session whilst my
workbench and hacking session is in another.

this is pretty easy, the only thing I raelly need to think about is how these
two sessions will be started.

Firstly I remove the  communications related sessions into a new tmux configure
file as follows:

  project_name: comms
  project_root: ~/
  rvm: 1.9.2-head@global
  pre: cd ~/ && bundle
  tabs:
    - Interwepts: w3m http://google.com
    - IRC: irssi
    - "Newsfeed": newsbeuter
    - "Podcasts": podbeuter
    - Email: mutt
    - Spyhole: tail -f ~/comms.log
    - "Dotfile Diaries": cd ~/Documents/Diary && vi book/book.asc
    - Top: top

This leaves me with the following 'workbench' setup:

  project_name: workbench
  project_root: ~/
  rvm: 1.9.2-head@global
  pre: cd ~/ && bundle
  tabs:
    - Workbench: vim
    - Spyhole: tail -f ~/workbench.log
    - Toybox: be pry
    - 'Control centre': git wtf

I now have two separate sessions to deal with my main two workflows further
helping me to keep my workflows focussed and without switching context too
much. Now I need to make sure that I can load these two sessions easily whilst
keeping their session location in guessable positions.

All I need to do is add the following to my `.zlogin` file:

  mux comms && mux workbench

This will automatically start both sessions as soon as I start a zsh session.
This could be moved to `.profile` if needed but for the moment I won't worry
too much about that as I tend to use zsh more than anything else.

Once this is done I make sure that I only start iTerm with a default session
and let `.zlogin` do the rest of the work.
