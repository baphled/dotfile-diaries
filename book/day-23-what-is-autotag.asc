=== What is Autotag

This has been breifly touch on when adding my
link:day_18.html#_adding_ctags[ctags] though I haven't really spoken about
what it actually does and what it's benefits are.

Firstly, the first issue with updating ctags is that when running `ctags -a`
you'd only update the current tags list whilst not removing tags that are no
longer needed.

Autotag updates the ctags for a project everytime a file is saved. This is
needed so that my ctags don't become stale and include definitions that are no
longer present in the project I am currently working on. Meaning that when
pressing `<C-]>` I only get results that are relevent to the project and don't
have to sift through a load of useless results.

Autotag requires 'Python' support so it is important to have support for this
in my 'Vim'. Thankfully if my Vim doesn't support 'Python' then it doesn't not
fail horribly. These saves me from having to clear my tags manually and just
focus on the task at hand, writing code.
