==== Being unimpaired

Now I have my ctags setup and I'm nearly complete with setting up my essentials
for my day to day work, I will finially install 'unimpaired'.

  git submodule add git://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired.git bundle/vim-unimpaired

I forgot to add this when I removed bundle and a couple of my custom bindings
relay on the plugin to help move lines around.

Now I have to do some tweaking to custom bindings so that they work without my
cursor keys as those have been disabled in Insert and Visual model.

Originally I had the following mappings for moving files up and down. This
functionality emulated textmates line mnaipulation functionality and allowed me
to easily move selections of lines around easily without poluting my paste
buffer.

 * `<C-Up>` - Move a line up
 * `<C-Down>` - Move a line down

These are set for both Normal and Visual mode so that I can move single and
multiple lines easily.

I still don't want to encourage the use of my cursor keys so I will remap these
to the following:

 * `<C-K>` - Move a line up
 * `<C-J>` - Move a line down

Now instead of having to use <Up> and <Down> I can use J and K as I do with
most of my other vim motions.
