=== Installing RVM

So the first thing i'll need is RVM. This will be needed by my zsh
prompt and for the dependancies for my workflow.

I like to have the latest version of Ruby so I can keep up with what's
new in the latest releases.

  curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby

This will install the latest version of RVM and Ruby, so I am well on my
way to getting Ruby setup on my system.

Once rvm and the latest version of Ruby installed I wanted to change my
setup so that the gems installed as part of my dotfiles are now
installed in global, so that they are available everywhere.

To do this I needed to make sure I was in the global gemset which was
done by using the following command.

  rvm gemset use global

Now that I am using the correct gemset, I need to make sure that I run
bundle to make sure that everything is in place.

  bundle

Once this is complete I have all my gems and rvm setup and ready to go.
