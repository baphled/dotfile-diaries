==== snipmate and snippets

  plugin:     snipmate-snippets
  homepage:   http://github.com/baphled/snipmate-snippets
  source:     git://github.com/baphled/snipmate-snippets.git

So I like to have shortcuts for commonly typed words and command, especially when I am coding, for this omnicomplete is
cool to an extent but it doesn't quite cover exactly what I am looking for. This is where 'snipmate' comes into play. It
allows you to create and use custom keys accompanied by `<TAB>` to quickly type a string. In the past snipmate came with
a host of snippets as part of the plugin but as time has gone on it has dropped them as the list of snippets is quite
exhaustive. They now belong as part of 'snipmate-snippets'. I'm also not a fan of having bloated customisations and have
decided to fork 'snipmate-snippets' so that I can tweak it to my needs. For the time being it is enough to be aware of
this and once I stripped down my config, I will put a little time aside for stripping down customising my snippets.
