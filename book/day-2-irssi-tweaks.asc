==== Grabbing links

I want to a way to handle links, their everywhere and their useful, to do this
I'll use bjurl.pl to highlight links and give me the ability to open and copy
them.

I used this version of
http://raw.github.com/sukima/bjurl/master/bjurl.pl[bjurl]. I'll copy it to
the usual place (`~/.irssi/scripts/autorun`) we can than run the script and we
have a nicely highlighted URL's :D

To open files we'll need to do some more configuration, as I'm on a mac, I'll
download Lynx and get it to open in a new tmux window. We'll setup our browser as lynx as it's a command line browser.
