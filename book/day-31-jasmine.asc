==== jasmine.vim

  plugin:     jasmine.vim

I like to test what I'm coding and javascript is no exception, the best unit test tool I've used so far is 'Jasmine'. I
prefer this as it is not that far removed from 'rspec' and it allows me to cleanly write tests whilst driving out
implementation code. I've been using jasmine.vim to help tweak vim to support the framework and provide me with some
useful snippets so that I don't have to type too much. It also has the added feature of allowing you to run specs from
within vim, which I am used to doiing for my specs and scenarios. Another benefit of this plugin is it provides
boilerplates for generating new jasmine files, which again saves me from having to repeat myself constantly.

There are a couple of things I'd like to do to keep things centralised. Firstly move the snippets into my custom
snippets repository. Keeping all my snippets in one place is going to save me hunting them down later which I'd rather
not do. I'd also like to move the templates into a centralised place so that I can build up some boilerplates for other
bits that I work on (rspec, controllers, models, etc).

The plugin also support syntax highlighting which is always quite useful. For the time being I'll gloss over the
snippets bundled in this plugin and go over them once I have them centralised.
