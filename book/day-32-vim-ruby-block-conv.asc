This plugin is pretty straight forward, it basically allows you to convert do/end blocks into {} and vice version.
That's all there is to it really.

I tend to use this when a block is more than 1 line or when it ends up being more than a 1 liner. I also use it when in
OCD mode and find a block that could be converted for consistency.

It adds two mapping `:B` and `<leader>B` to convert blocks and is smart enough to work out what needs to be done. There
is nothing else to it.
