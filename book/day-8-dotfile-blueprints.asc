=== Dotfile blueprints

So this is where the plan starts to come together.

My dotfiles should be a collection of settings and utilities that help me with
my day to day work. As time has gone on I've learnt what I like and what I
don't and have always like the idea of having one group setting that can go
anywhere. Back in the it was my personal CVS repository, these days its github.

NOTE:
This link will need to be changed when we start the new version or clean up the
current.

I already have my dotfiles https://github.com/baphled/dotfiles[here].
