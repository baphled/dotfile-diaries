=== Adding a newsreader my workbench

So the final step in add a newsreader to my workbench is actually attaching a
window to my workbench so that I can easily view my news feed at my own
leisure.

The first thing to do is add a new window to my workbench config

  "Newsfeed": newsbeuter

NOTE: Add link to my updated workbench config. 

I then kill my session and restart it again and I now have a separate session
to view my newsfeed.

I've added this just after my IRC Window so that I have all my communicated
centric windows all together.

=== TODO

  * How do you add and remove feeds
  * How can I download podcasts
  * How to customise key bindings to be more like vim
  * Tweet articles I've read
    * May be able to use ifft for this
  * Talk more about my config
