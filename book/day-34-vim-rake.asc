==== vim-rake

This provides all the niceness of `vim-rails` without actually needing to work on a rails project. So commands like
`:Rake` are provided here.

 * `:A` - Open the alternate file
 * `:AV` - Open the alternate file in a new vertical split
 * `:AS` - Open the alternate file in a new split
 ** this is useful when open Gemfile.lock or opening a test file.
 * `:Rlib` - Edit a file under the lib/ directory
 * `:Rtags` - Run ctags for the project
