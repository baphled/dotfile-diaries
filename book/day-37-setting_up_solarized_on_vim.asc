==== Settings up Solarized Dark for Vim

The next step is get my Vim setup with Solarized also.

This was pretty straight forward. I simply had to add the vim-solarized plugin into my dotvim files (add link to
change here).

I then had to change the colorscheme to solarized and everything was good to go. The next time I started Vim Solarized
was setup. :)

There was one thing was I couldn't do without, and that was my column width colour. I found a code snippet that fitted
the purpose so I add that to my `~/.vimrc` file.

I could possibly improve this a little bit more but for the time being it'll do.
