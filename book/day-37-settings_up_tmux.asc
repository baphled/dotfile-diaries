==== Setting up Tmux with Solarized Dark

Now it's time to get tmux setup with Solarized Dark also. I already had a bunch of custom color settings but I've
decided to do away with those and primarily use Solarized. First off I removed the existing colour settings and
downloaded the tmux colour scheme from https://raw.github.com/seebi/tmux-colors-solarized/master/tmuxcolors-dark.conf.

TODO: Display snippet of the change.

This was then copied to my tmuxfiles repositories and linked to from with my tmux.conf file.

Once that was done I simple ran the following command to update my current session.

`source ~/.tmux.conf`

Now that everything is setup. My setup now looks like this:
