I've spent quite alot of time looking for a colour scheme that suits my needs. This is so far my favourite having said
that I'd like to be able to dynamically switch colour schemes dependant on what I am doing.

NOTE: Add a screenshot of the colour scheme

I'd also like to have some kind of colour scheme management tool to make it easier to separate colorschemes and maintaim
them. What would be cool would be if there was a plugin that allowed me to sample a range of colorschemes and settle on
a given range, similar to the way colour schemes are managed in oh-my-zsh.

This will be something that I deal with once I have gone over the plugins I currently have.
