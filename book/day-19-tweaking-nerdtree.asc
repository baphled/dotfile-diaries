==== Tweaking Nerdtree 

So I've played with Nerdtree in the past but dropped it to make sure of
Netrw. I've done this for a number of weeks but I still prefer Nerdtree
so I'll be reinstalling it and updating my settings.

  git submodule add git://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git bundle/nerdtree

I also add the following so that NERDTree is loaded automatically if no
files are opened when starting vim.

  autocmd vimenter * if !argc() | NERDTree | endif

That's it, it couldn't be easier. All that is left is to map NERDTree to a
binding so that it is easy to call.

  :noremap <C-p> :NERDTreeToggle<CR>

I'll also need to cancel out 'Ctrl-P' default binding so that they don't clash.

  let g:ctrlp_map = '<unique> <silent> <Leader><Leader>'

As Ctrl-P uses <C-p> as a default mapping I just change this so that it it uses
double <leader> leaving Nerdtree to freely use <C-p>.
