=== Getting a feed reader

So the next step along this journey is to setup a news reader. I've looked at a
few that I used to use in the past.

I stumbled on https://github.com/posativ/homebrew-newsbeuter[newsbeuter] which
is a cli with a mutt feel. Ideal for me as I'm an avid mutt user.

Unfortunately brew can't find newsbeuter by it's self so I needed to tell it
where it is and then install it on my system.

  brew tap posativ/homebrew-newsbeuter

This installs the brew formula needed to install newsbeuter. Once this was complete all I had to do is run:

  brew install newsbeuter

Again I had to wait, this time for newsbeuter to install, and then I was ready
to play with newsbeuter.

I use GoogleReader for all my RSS feeds so I needed the following in my
`~/.newsbeuter/config` file.

  urls-source "googlereader"
  googlereader-login "your-googlereader-account"

I also wanted to be able to share and star articles so I also added the following mappings

  googlereader-flag-share "a"
  googlereader-flag-star "b"

NOTE: Need a way to not have to disclose my google user id.

Once I started `newsbeuter` I had an empty list of feeds that I have subscribed
to in the past. The only thing left for me to do was to press 'R' and wait for
all of my feeds to update :)

Navigating through feeds is similar to vi but I'd like to actually have the
basic bindings in place so that I don't have to keep changing context.

It would also be cool if I could tweak the layout so that it looked more like
my mutt setup. I'm not sure on how easy this but I'll look into this and see
how easy it is to achieve.

It's important to be able to view links easily, I'll continue to use w3m as my
browser of choice as it is already configured and working pretty well.
newsbeuter also has podcast support :) so I can keep up to date with my
podcasts without having to rely on itunes.

In my `~/.newsbeuter/config` file I added the following:

  browser w3m

Now that is setup I can easily open links by proving the number associated to
the link of interest.

=== TODO

  * Find out how to delete a feed
  * How to add odps files along with GoogleReader
  * Only display unread blogs articles
