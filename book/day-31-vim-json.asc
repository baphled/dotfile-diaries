==== vim-json

This plugin is basically adds syntax highlighting and file type detection so that the JSON format is recognisable by
vim. There really isn't thing else to it.

As I use JSON quite a bit for my day to day work, this functionality is indespensible and saves me trying to add it to
my vimrc file which is the last thing I want to do.
