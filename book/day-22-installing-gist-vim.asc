=== Install gist-vim

As I don't have this installed for some reason and I'm due to starting
reviewing my vim packages, I thought I'd start with gist-vim. I tend to need to
post gists quickly and I usually end up using vim to write these notes and
snippets.

The only problem with this is that I have to go find the file and then copy and
paste the contents via the website. That's kinda slow and annoying. I've used
gist-vim in the past so it's time to get that setup and running so that I can
send my gists easier.

Same as usual I start by install the plugin:
  
  git submodule add git://github.com/mattn/gist-vim.git bundle/gist-vim

I also need `webapi-vim` which deal with the API calls to github. As I don't
need to install it, as it's already installed I'll gloss over how it was
installed as it is just a case of adding the plugin and forgetting about it.

My `plugin.vim` doesn't have any settings for `gist-vim` so I'll add them now
and then go over the basic commands I'll need to play around with gist via vim.

I want to be able to copy snippets from a gist:
  let g:gist_clip_command = 'pbcopy'

I also want to try to detect the file type gists should be when uploading them:
  let g:gist_detect_filetype = 1

The default command is `:Gist` and `:'<,'>Gist` with the following flags for
the various options:

  * `-p` - a private gist
  * `-P` - a public gist
  * `-m` - save a gist with all the buffers
  * `-e` - edit the gist in the current buffer
  * `-d` - delete a gist
  * `-l` - list my gists
  * `-l username` - list a users gists

I could map a few of these commands but I'll hold off on that for the moment
and just get accustomed to calling it manually.
