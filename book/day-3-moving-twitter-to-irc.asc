=== Setting up twitter in my console

For this we'll use http://github.com/zigdon/twirssi/issues[twirssi],
recommended to me by http://twitter.com/23me[@23me], who I used to spend a lot
of time chatting on IRC with in my misspent youth.

=== The setup

So the first step is to download and setup the script and take it from there.

We'll need to add the Net::Twitter from CPAN: 

    sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install Net::Twitter'
    sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install JSON::Any'

We'll also need to run the script and pass our username:

    /win new hidden
    /win name twitter
    /script load twirssi.pl
    /twitter_login username
    /twirssi_oauth <username>@Twitter <pin>

This will create a new hidden window call it twitter and load the script and
finally set the username. You will then be asked to authorise the application
by visiting the displayed link, once this is done, you should then be ready to
use twitter via irssi :)

    /layout save
    /save

Now you settings are saved we can happily close irssi knowing that our setup
will still persist :D
