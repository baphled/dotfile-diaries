=== Getting an itinerary

So I've spent some time gathering some plugins to help tweak my workflow. Now
is the time I take stock of what I have and determine what can stay, what
should go and what do I need to learn more.

There won't be any technical stuff done here, well not really, as the main
focus is to get an idea of what I really need and what do I need to learn to
improve my vimfu.

I've hacked together a basic little script that will output names of submodules
within a git repository, in this case my vim plugins, and will use this as a
basis to review each plugin one by one.

[source,bash]
~~~~
include::include/module_list.sh[]
~~~~

I now have a nice list of plugins that I have stored locally.

Now I have the list of plugins I'm using I can starting organising them
into the order in which I'll gradually learn them.

The progression will be tracked for the next few weeks until I have a
decent understanding of them each and have at least burnt the basics of
each into muscle memory.
