Ack is probably one of my most used linux commands so it goes without
saying that I'd like the same functionality for finding string within
Vim the same way.

It depends on 'ack' so that needed to be installed so that I could take
advantage of the plugin. Thankfully I had that already installed but for
reference this is how I installed it on my box

  brew install ack

To run 'ack' I just need to type the following:

  :Ack --type=ruby 'content to find' path/to/find/content/

This will search for 'content to find' within any 'ruby' file within the
'path/to/find/content' directory. There is an extensive list of file
types 'ack' supports which can be found at 'ack --help-types'. It is
also possible to omit file types also as follows:
  
  :Ack --notype=ruby 'content to find' path/to/find/content/
