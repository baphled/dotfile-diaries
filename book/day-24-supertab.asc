==== Supertab

****
  plugin: supertab
  home:   http://github.com/ervandew/supertab
  source: git://github.com/ervandew/supertab.git

So this plugin will help enhance my autocompletion functionality. As stated in
my previous entry I'd like to be able to use tabs to loop through my completion
list when it comes up. Supertab does this for me so I'll have a play with that
and see how it pans out.

  git submodule add git://github.com/ervandew/supertab.git bundle/vim-supertab

Once this was completed I just had to restart my vim session.

  let g:SuperTabCrMapping=0

As I'm using 'delimitMate' I need the above setting so that 'supertab' does not
conflict with it.

Now everything is setup I can use tabs as I I'd like to.
