== Setting up git-scribe

It's not directly related but I love to write and I'd like my setup to
allow me to easily write new material and publish them in various formats.

I've been watching git-scribe for some time and thought this would be a
perfect time to bring it into my current workflow.

I'll setup git-scribe as it allows me to write my entries in AsciiDoc
format and compile it into a number of formats (html, pdf, mobi, etc).

As this is the case we'll have a play with this setup and possibly use
it for publishing other material.

There's not much to this really the project has great

Once installed I started initialised the new book.

    git scribe init
