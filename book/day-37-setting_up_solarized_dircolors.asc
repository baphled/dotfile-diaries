==== Setting up Solarized dircolours

So I'm almost complete but I'm not quite happy about the colouring of the directory names, or shall I say lack of colour.

There is a project that helps to change this (https://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized). I'd like to keep up to
date with this project but easily switch out the settings if needed. I'll create a colourschemes directory that I will
keep my colour settings in. I then linked the desired colour scheme for dircolors `ln -s
~/colour_schemes/dircolors.256 ~/.dir_colors`

I also had to install coreutils to get access to the dircolours command.

`brew install coreutils --default-names`

Once this was installed I could then add the following code snippet to `~/.zshrc`.
