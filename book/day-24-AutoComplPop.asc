This plugin is yet another enhancement, it helps by displaying a popup
for text completions. This is nice as it helps be to quickly type words
that are already with my buffer with little effort.

There is one issue I currently have with this plugin and that is being
able to press `<Tab>` and `<Shift>+<Tab>` to loop through possible
options. As it stand the defaults are `<Ctrl-N` and `<Ctrl-P>`.

  :set completeopt=longest,menu

I could possibly remap the defaults to `<Tab>` and `<Shift>+<Tab>`
respectively but I'd like to give `supertab` a try. I'll document that
in my next entry.
