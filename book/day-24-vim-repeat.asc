Essentially this plugins is an enhancer and allows me to to repeat
'commands' that I've previously executed.

Here's a list of plugins I use that will be enhanced by adding this plugin:

  * surround.vim
  * abolish.vim
  * unimpaired.vim


These plugins are also enhanced though I do not currently use them.

  * speeddating.vim
  * commentary.vim

It also allows me to add this functionality to oher plugins by adding
the following code snippet to the my custom bindings.

  silent! call repeat#set("\<Plug>MyWonderfulMap", v:count)

Where MyWonderfulMap is the name of the command I'd like to add repeat
functionality to. It's that simple.

Later once I have completed this section I'll take a step back and have
more of a play with this plugin and determine commands that would
benefit from such functionality.
