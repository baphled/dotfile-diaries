===== Removing supertab 

So I've discovered some issues with using 'supertab' conflicting with 'snipmate' and to be quite honest though I used to
use tabs for autocompletion but I my vim muscle memory is used to using `<C-n>` and `<C-p>` to loop through possible
selections. There is also the factor that I _am_ used to using tabs for completing snippets.

The other consideration is that I still want to try to keep my underlining settings as similar to vanilla vim as
possible whilst tweaking it another for extra productivity.

So removing 'supertab' seems like a good idea. So with that said I'm going to remove supertab.

  rm -rf ~/.git/modules/dotvim/modules/bundle/vim-supertab/
  rm -rf ~/dotvim/bundle/vim-supertab/
  
Finally I need to remove the submodule from `~/dotvim/.gitmodules`

  vi ~/dotvim/.gitmodules

  /supertab
  d2j
  :wq

NOTE: Make sure that the above instructions are added as a separate workflow.
