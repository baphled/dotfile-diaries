This is plugin is probably one of the most used by myself when writing. It basically allow use to add and remove a tag
text. This is especially useful when working with (X|HT)ML as it requires us to wrap content with in elements, which can
become tedious at the best of times.

The mappings for manipulating content comes in the following prefixes:

  * cs - Change Surrounding tag
  * ds - Delete Surrounding tag
  * ys - Your Surrounding tag
  ** takes a tag and replacing tag

I tend to use the first two the most but I'd like to learn more about what the other really have to offer instead of
sticking to what I already know. This plugin is quite extensive so I'll spend more time on getting to grips with the
mappings that I have not used often.

There are a couple of cool things I can do with these mappings one of the main ones is being able to add tags to
multiple lines at once. One prime example of where this comes in handy is when we want to create a list of HTML
elements. First we'd get a list of something.

  <ul>
    <li>Rice</li>
    <li>Beans</li>
    <li>Chocolate</li>
  </ul>

Then we'd type the following:

  ggVG
  '<,'>normal yss<li>
  ggVGS<ul>

Which gives us the output below:

  <ul>
    <li>Rice</li>
    <li>Beans</li>
    <li>Chocolate</li>
  </ul>

So what if I want to have the original list back, the standard way of doing this would be to type u a few times. That's
boring, surround can help us here to with a couple of commands:

  ggVG
  '<,'>normal dst
  
We end up with the content pretty much back to normal:

  Rice
  Beans
  Chocolate
