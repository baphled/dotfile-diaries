=== Tweaking Nerdtree 

So I've played with Nerdtree in the past but dropped it to make sure of
Netrw. I've done this for a number of weeks but I still prefer Nerdtree
so I'll be reinstalling it and updating my settings.

  git submodule add git://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git bundle/nerdtree

I also add the following so that NERDTree is loaded automatically if no
files are opened when starting vim.

  autocmd vimenter * if !argc() | NERDTree | endif

That's it, it couldn't be easier. All that is left is to map NERDTree to a
binding so that it is easy to call.

  :noremap <C-p> :NERDTreeToggle<CR>
