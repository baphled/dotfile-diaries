==== Giving my syntax some sugar

Now I want to get tweak my ruby syntax recognition some more so this
seems like the idea time to do so.

Enable highlighted operators

  :let ruby_operators = 1

I want to be alerted when there are space errors, these don't actually
cause errors but it would be nice to be able to easily see them.

  :let ruby_space_errors = 1

NOTE: Write about motions and text objects
