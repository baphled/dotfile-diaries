So dealing with buffers can be somewhat frustrating at times, especially if you
keep a session running for a number of days, as I do, the one thing missing
from Vim is a way to easily navigation open buffers and manage them as needed.

I came across bufexplorer a few weeks ago whilst watching another developer
coding and flipping buffers. After looking at their vim files I noticed that
they had been using bufexplorer to do this and quickly added it to my
toolchain. It's easy to configure and adds the nice feature of being able to
list buffers and select and delete them quite easily.

The first things I did was to remap its default (`<leader>be`) to `<leader>,.`
mainly as the former feels more natural. There are a few more mappings that it
uses that I haven't gotten around to making use of yet and it will be these
that I'll be playing around with from now on. They are as follows:

  <leader>bs
  <leader>bv

As you may or may not of figured out this opens bufexplorer in a horizontal and
vertical split respectively.

The most common command I use at present is deleting buffers (`d`) and jumping
to a given buffer. The former still feels a little clumsy, probably as I'm not
making the use of the out of the box commands and defaulting to using search to
find a buffer and press `<Enter>` when I've found the buffer I am interested in.

Below is a snippet of the docs which lists some of the internal commands
bufexplorer supports:

   R             Toggles relative path/absolute path.
   D            |:wipeout|the buffer under the cursor from the list.  When a
                 buffers is wiped, it will not be shown when unlisted buffer are
                 displayed.
   f             Toggles whether you are taken to the active window when
                 selecting a buffer or not.
   o             Opens the buffer that is under the cursor into the current
                 window.
   p             Toggles the showing of a split filename/pathname.
   q             Quit exploring.
   r             Reverses the order the buffers are listed in.
   s             Selects the order the buffers are listed in. Either by buffer
                 number, file name, file extension, most recently used (MRU), or
                 full path.
   u             Toggles the showing of "unlisted" buffers.

I don't use tabs, in fact I'd rather stay away from them as much as possible so
that commands relating to those have been omitted.

I'm going to have a play around with the other settings to see how useful they
are and go from there.

The biggest plus for me is the ability to easily delete buffers without having
to remember the buffers number. This alone is a good enough reason to keep it
in my toolchain.
