== Goal

The goal of this blog is to track my progression of improving my unix
and workflow.

I've come to love tmux, oh-my-zsh, vim, rvm and bundle. Setting up my
environemnt may well get more complex so I'll setup a script that will
check whether these tools are available and install them if they are not.

vim and oh-my-zsh are easy, I already have separate repositories for
these. I'm going to be opinionated for the moment an focus on installing
the other tools via brew and apt. I'll check the OS and use the correct
install recipe accordingly.

I'll start off with a very basic workbench and build it up to the point
where it it optimal for my personal use and configurable enough for
others to do the same too.

== Day 1

So this is the first day of an on going process devised by myself to help
improve and tweak my existing workflow.

For years I've been used to living in the console and staying away from GUI
type tools to do my day to day work

So the idea is to move back to my console and improve my workflow by tweaking
and getting to know my console tools better.

In this blog I'll start with something simple, as the days progress I create a
blog describing what I've learnt today and how it improves my day to day
workflow.

Today is an easy day, I'll start with setting up irssi, a command line
interface for IRC.

What I want here is my old setup tweaked to make it easy to change channels and
see is in a room.

== Day 2

So I've in the previous posts I've setup irssi and setup twirssi so that I can
keep up to date with my tweets without having to deal with a GUI.

Now I want to tweak my settings so that I can open links easily and have a few
more channels setup in hidden windows.

I'd also like to setup vim-mode for irssi

Today I'll be tweaking Irssi so that I can interact with my Instant
Messagers and twitter accounts.

== Day 3

So for today, I'd like to stop using twitter and move it my console. I love
Twitter but GUIs are hella slow and I'd like a lot more control over what I can
see when and how it's displayed.

== Day 4

So we`ve done quite a bit to get irssi setup and working as I want it.
The last things I want to do is lose my settings or messing something
up, as I have done a number of times already.

== Day 5

So we've got Lynx setup to work with irssi, after doing so I found out
that w3m can deal with tabs and images. Admittedly I'm not particularly
a fan of tabs, mainly as I tend to build up quite a collection of these
and never really go back to them, but I'll give it a whirl and see what
the pros and cons of it as opposed to lynx.

== Day 6

I've been writing quite a bit recently and have wanted to play around with git-scribe for authoring my diary and possibly writing projects in the future.

Today I'll be setting up git-scribe and updating my diary so that I can generate content in various formats. Initially I'll only publish this content as HTML but then move on to PDF and epub later once I've ironed out the kinks.
