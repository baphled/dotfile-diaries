=== Adding multiple SMTP accounts

So I have my personal email accounts setup, so now I can read all my emails and
filter them pretty easily. The only thing missing here is being able to respond
to emails with the correct email address.

So the problem at the moment is that all emails I send are set to my username
and machines hostname (my.username@my.machines.name.com), which is obviously
what I want, I need to update mutt so that it can tell which email address to
use as the sender.

This requires quite a bit of setup so I'll hold of on doing the actual setup
and work out what I actually need to do to all me to choose which account to
send emails.

The first thing I'll need to do is make sure that the 'From' field in my email
responses are not that of the local machine. This should actually be the email
address that the email was sent to.

I'm not quite sure how to do this yet so I'll put a fork in it for the moment
so that I can focus on getting the rest of my setup functional.
