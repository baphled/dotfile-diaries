== Adding our IM to irssi

So we've done quite a bit with our irc client in ways of centralising communicaions, wouldn't it be cool if we could get our IM's to play nicely too? Well it seems that it isn't much of a problem.

We'll download bitlbee and create a new window for it in our irssi client.

First, the download:

    brew install bitlbee

Now we can connect to one of the bitlbee servers and get things setup.

    /win new hidden
    /win name bitlbee
    /server im.uk.bitlbee.org 6667
 
This should automatically join you to the "&bitlbee" channel, this is where
you'll be able to setup your account and send messages :)

Once connected you'll need to register and set a password

    /register <username>
    /OPER

Once you have entered these commands you will be prompted to enter your password

All set? good, now we can start adding accounts

    account add jabber <your gmail email address>
    /OPER

Now you can enter your IM's password. Rince and repeat until you have added all your accounts.

Finally call `account on` bitlbee will connect you to all of your accounts :)

All accounts successfully connected to will be stored so the next time you connect to bitlbee all you need to do is run the following commands

    /identify <username>
    /OPER
    
Once you enter your password you can then call `account on` and log into all IM's

Simples :D
