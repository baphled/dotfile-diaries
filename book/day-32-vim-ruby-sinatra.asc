This plugin adds the ability to recognise sinatra based files as well as adding syntax highlighting and snippets to help
reduce the amount of keys I press. I'd rather the snippets were in my custom snipmate-snippets project but for now this
will do.

As there isn't much to this plugin and I'd like to centralise the snippets I won't spend time going over them just now
and leave that for when I deal with centralising my snippets.
