==== Setting up git-scribe

It's not directly related but I love to write and I'd like my setup to
allow me to easily write new material and publish them in various formats.

I've been watching git-scribe for some time and thought this would be a
perfect time to bring it into my current workflow.

I'll setup git-scribe as it allows me to write my entries in AsciiDoc
format and compile it into a number of formats (html, pdf, mobi, etc).

As this is the case we'll have a play with this setup and possibly use
it for publishing other material.

There's not much to this really the project has great

Once installed I started initialised the new book.

    git scribe init

Once this was done I had the basic setup needed to move my diary. git-scribe
uses AsciiDoc to format content so I needed to convert the old markdown. That
wasn't so much trouble as there isn't much different in the markup. I created a
couple of vim macros and went through the pages and updated them accordingly.
The main changes needed were related to the titles of each entry.

Once the files where moved into the 'book' directory and the format of the
content was setup it was easy to generate the site with one command `git scribe
gen site`. In the 'output' directory was the generated diary nicely formatted
and indexed.

===== TODO

  * It would be nice to automatically resize images so that they are not too
    large or too small.
  * create a script that generates my diary into HTML
    * the output will be another repository
