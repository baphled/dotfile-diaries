I've had this installed pretty much from day one and never really used it. I
guess I typically store my notes in gists or evernotes. The latter I have not
got a plugin for, this will go on the 'to get' list.

Pastie basically does the same as gist-vim put post the content of a buffer(s)
to pastie. As I don't have any need for this functionality I'll remove it from
my dotvim.

  vi .gitmodules
  / pastie<CR>
  d2j
  :wq

This will open `.gitmodules` in vim find the word 'pastie' and delete that line
and the 2 below it. Finally we save the changes and quit the file.

Next I needed to remove the plugin manually with `git rm bundle/vim-pastie`
