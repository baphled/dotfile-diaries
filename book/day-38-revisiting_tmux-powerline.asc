==== Revisiting tmux-powerline

So today is the day that I actually get around to updating tmux-powerline. As mentioned in my previous entry it was a
bit of a pain to customise tmux-powerline, mainly due to the fact that you had to create a new fork and customise the
status bars to how you wanted them to be.

This has all changed quite significantly over the past month or so so I need to make sure that I don't break anything
and keep my setup as close to the original as possible.

The first step was to update my fork of the project with the latest changes and get that working as closely as
possible to my current setup. One of the nice things I like about the latest update is that there is now no need to
fork the project to customise the feel of it. You simply create generate a new theme, customise it and then move it to
a separate directory, in my case I've put it under 'themes' within the 'tmuxfiles' project. I also had a custom
segment that I used to display who I am currently logged in as. I had to remove this from my forked repository, tweak
it (as the script structure had changed) and put that in a new directory (segments) within the 'tmuxfiles' project.
These changes were really needed and make the project as a whole a lot nicer to work with.

I then had to tweak my tmux settings to point to the updated forked version of the repository. This way I can test the
setup locally without having to commit to anything, pun intended. This was as easy as changing where tmux-powerline is
found and playing around with the settings until it was about right.

As before I still don't want a right status bar, mainly as my status list will populate this part of tmux-powerline.
So effectively I left that pretty much as it was. I spend quite a bit of time getting the colours right and tweaking
the ordering of segments so that it looked better than before but that didn't take that long to do.

As a whole I quite like the recent changes to the project, especially the ability to overide where themes and segments
are found. This means that there will is no more having to merge my changes with the project and also allows me to be
more creative without being concerned that things will change dramatically without me noticing.

Though this is setup quite nicely at present, there is talk of moving tmux-powerline to the powerline project, would
could be interesting. It kind of makes sense having a central powerline repository. But for now I won't worry about
that happening but I am sure there will be yet another entry explaining those changes and how I ended up integrating
that into my current setup.
