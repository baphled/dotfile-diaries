This plugin was covered on link:/day-19-being-unimpaired[day 19]. I only
touched on the customisations that I wanted and not what 'unimpaired'
actually offers.

Here's a list of some of the nmemoics it has to offer:

 * `[a` |:previous|
 * `]a` |:next|
 * `[A` |:first|
 * `]A` |:last|
 * `[b` |:bprevious|
 * `]b` |:bnext|
 * `[B` |:bfirst|
 * `]B` |:blast|
 * `[l` |:lprevious|
 * `]l` |:lnext|
 * `[L` |:lfirst|
 * `]L` |:llast|
 * `[q` |:cprevious|
 * `]q` |:cnext|
 * `[Q` |:cfirst|
 * `]Q` |:clast|
 * `[t` |:tprevious|
 * `]t` |:tnext|
 * `[T` |:tfirst|
 * `]T` |:tlast|

I already have custom mapping for `:cnext` and `cprevious` as `<leader>j` and
`<leader>k` respectively. I won't be needing those anymore as I now have `[q`
and  `q]` to do this for me.

So I remove the following from my 'binding.vim':

  nmap <leader>j :cn<CR>
  nmap <leader>k :cp<CR>

I can also remove the custom mappings I added on
link:day-18-adding-ctags[day 18 - Adding ctags] as these are already setup
with unimpaired. 

  noremap ]t :tnext<CR>
  noremap [t :tprev<CR>

One of the most useful motions will be moving to the next and previous conflict
in a file. This has always been somewhat tedious and having an simple mapping
for it will help no end.

 * `[n` - Go to the next SCM conflict
 * `n]` - Go to the previous SCM conflict
