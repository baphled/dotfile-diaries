=== Starting a new

So the first thing I'll need to do is stripped down my repository so that
I can start a new.

WARNING:
This can be somewhat hazardious if you rely on having all of your
downloads in your home directory as the following command will remove
everything from your repository and working directory

This will be used to stripped down my dotvim repository and help me
start from scratch whilst keeping my master branch intacted.

  git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/stripped
  rm .git/index
  git clean -fdx

This took some time and basically removed everything in my home
directory, which I didn't really think about prior to running the
command. So going back was not really an option.

Once the command had finished all my personal setting were removed and I
recieved a bunch of errors relating to RVM not being found. This was
because my zsh settings rely on RVM for prompt information.

So the first thing I want to do is change into bash and get RVM back up
and running.
