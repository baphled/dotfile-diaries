I've had this plugin for a while plugin for a while but I've only just
scratched the surface of what I can actually do with it.

I typically only use the commenting part of this plugin and at that the
very basic.

  * `<leader>/` - comments out a line

I tend to use Visual mode to select the lines I want to comment out and
use the above to get the job done. There is however a better way of
doing this.

  X<leader>c

Where `X` is the number of lines you want to comment out.

I've noticed that `<leader>cy` is a pretty cool too as it comments out a
line but yanks its content first so that you can past is elsewhere. This
is typically useful if you need to modify a line but also want to keep
the orginal commented out but want to past the line or a modified
version of it somewhere else. As with `<leader>c` `<leader>cy` can be
prefixed with a number allowing you to yank and then copy as many
consecutive lines as you please.

There is also `<leader>cA` which also comments out a line but also
enters you into Insert mode at the end of a line ready to make a change.
This is also accompanied by `<leader>c$` which does the same but puts
you at the start of the line.
