== Notes

Getting irssi to open up links in w3m as a new tab is pretty easy. Especially
with the aid of tmux. We'll need to add the following snippet to irssi:
    /set browse_command "tmux send-keys -t Interwepts 'T U %u' C-m &"

  * Make navigating to a window easier
  * Comment on how to automatically send commands to a IRC channel
    * This is done for the bitlbee window to automatically login
  * Mappings
    * Open url in new tab
      * This will be used im irssi by bjurl
    * Automatically sign into twitter
    * Automatically sign in to bitlbee
