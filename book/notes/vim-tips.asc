=== Vim tips

problem: Get spaces between surrouding characters ({,( and friends)

solution: Make sure you use the closing tag, this way there will not be a space between the special characters and the
inner text.

problem: Display line width solution: Add the following to your vimrc:

  set colorcolumn=140
  set tw=140

This sets the linecount to 140 and displays a vertical line where the line limit is.
