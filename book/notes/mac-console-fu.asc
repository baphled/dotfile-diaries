=== Mac console fu

Having the Control key where it is as default can be quite a strain on
the fingers and I very rarely use the CAPLOCK key. So it's a good idea
to remap these keys so that I don't stress may fingers unnecessarily.

This is pretty easy to do on a mac. I needed to go to System settings
and click on 'Modifier keys'

I needed to change my modifier keys as follows.

Once I save the change, my CAPLOCK and Control keys are remapped.
