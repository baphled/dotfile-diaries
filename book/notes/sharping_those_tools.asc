=== Sharping those tools

=== How to improve our productivity?

We should ideally be learning new things, that we don't currently know, to
improve the way we solve and look at problems.

One of the best ways to do this is to actively learn something new every day.

For us, we'll learn a new Vim trick and learn more about the linux tools that
we have available to us and which can help improve the way we do our work day
to day.

=== What we do?

==== Read a man page a day

This can be quite hard to achieve, I've attempted this in the past, we'll make
this interesting. We'll create a simple script that will bring up a random man
page when ever you type `manit`.

We could also get this automatically by calling the script via a tmuxinator
config file.

==== Learn to use a new tool

There are a hell of a lot of cool utilities that come out of the box with any
Linux based machine, we should look into these and see how we can make use of
these for our day to day work.

Some utils we should look at:
  sed
  ack
  grep
  xargs

Solve an on going personal problem
  * Ideally this should be small changes, so we see the effect and benefit

==== Hone our new skills

We'll need to get our newly found knowledge stored to muscle memory, so we'll
need to practice what we have learnt over the week. Doing so will help us on
the way to improving the way we work and improve our skillset.
