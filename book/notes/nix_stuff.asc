== *nix Stuff

Here is where I'm going store the various titbit that I've learnt over the
years. I am assuming by the vagueness of this notion it will start of as a grap
bag of notes and gradually split off to different sections.

 * `map -k .` - list all of the man pages on the system
 * `man $(/bin/ls /bin | awk '{ cmd[i++] = $0 } END { srand( ); print cmd[int(rand()*length(cmd))]; }')'` - display a random manpage
