==== TODO

  * Work out how to stop surround from padding special chars ({,( and friends) with spaces
  * Make sure the shell is setup for zsh
  * Tweak settings to make writing markdown a little nicer
  * Able to open links and preview markdown via w3m
  * Add filetype `*.md` as `*.markdown`
  * Find a plugin for making markup with markdown more productive
    * Creating titles can be cumbersome
    * Building lists can be painful
  * mapping for toggling line numbers
  * map git-scribe gen
