==== Customisations

use Vundle for package management
Separate bindings into different files dependant on their function

==== Common commands

These are a few vi commands I use quie a lot, as in "I should alias"

    :Git ci --amend         # I'm forever amending commits

    :Git rebase --continue  # Nromall used after I merge conflicts 

    :bd                     # To destroy a buffer

    <C-W> n +               # Increase my window height

    <C-W> n -               # Decrease my window height

    :git scribe gen site    # Generate my diary

    :git scribe gen all     # Generate my diary in all versions


==== Macros

Set current line to soft tabs

    # Reset tabs to soft tabs
    :set et
    V =

Convert n number of lines into a list

    # Turn a number of sentences into bullet points
    V: normal I  * 

==== TODO

  * Work out how to stop surround from padding special chars ({,( and friends) with spaces
  * Make sure the shell is setup for zsh
  * Tweak settings to make writing markdown a little nicer
  * Able to open links and preview markdown via w3m
  * Add filetype `*.md` as `*.markdown`
  * Find a plugin for making markup with markdown more productive
    * Creating titles can be cumbersome
    * Building lists can be painful
  * mapping for toggling line numbers
  * Jump to last last line I was on when I open a file

=== Things to map

  * gup
  * git wtf
  * git-scribe gen

=== Things to learn

  * Explore plugin, how do we use this better


==== Tips

  * `dvf char` - delete up to char
  * `df char` - delete up to and including the char
  * `:windo e` - Refresh all window
