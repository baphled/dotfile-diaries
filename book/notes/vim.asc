=== Vim

I've used Vim for a while but I've also been getting way to used to having a
heap of bundles. I want to start out with a stripped down version of vim and
document my journey from working with an out of the box setup to finding the
learning some of the element I have neglected to learn up until now.

==== Customisations

use Vundle for package management
Separate bindings into different files dependant on their function

==== Common commands

These are a few vi commands I use quie a lot, as in "I should alias"

    :Git ci --amend         # I'm forever amending commits

    :Git rebase --continue  # Normally used after I merge conflicts 

    :bd                     # To destroy a buffer

    <C-W> n +               # Increase my window height

    <C-W> n -               # Decrease my window height

    :git scribe gen site    # Generate my diary

    :git scribe gen all     # Generate my diary in all versions


==== Macros

Set current line to soft tabs

    # Reset tabs to soft tabs
    :set et
    V =

Convert n number of lines into a list

    # Turn a number of sentences into bullet points
    V: normal I  * 

Search and replace over multiple files

    :argdo %s/2007/2008/g

[TODO]
  * create vim scripts based on my workflows
  * Make sure the shell is setup for zsh
  * Tweak settings to make writing markdown a little nicer
  * Able to open links and preview markdown via w3m
  * Add filetype `*.md` as `*.markdown`
  * Find a plugin for making markup with markdown more productively
  ** Creating titles can be cumbersome
  ** Building lists can be painful
  * The same as of above applies to `*.asc` and `*asciidoc`
  * mapping for toggling line numbers
  * Jump to last last line I was on when I open a file
  * script to clean out vim history
  ** start with duplicates
  * toggle line numbering
  * Format tables easily
  ** Using Align
  * Limit word wrap dependant on mime type
  ** I tend to prefer different limits dependant on what I am working on
  ** Display line limit
  * Save files when I changed tmux pain or window
  ** Would be cool if I could do this with iTerm also so that vim saves when I tab to another application.
  * Restart previous session
  ** Will help me to jump back into where I jumped off without having to manually remember what was open and where
  * Set wordwrap dependant on the filetype
  * Stop syntastic's from displaying me errors when writing step definitions.
  * fix issues with vim slowing down when using AutoComplPop

==== Things to map

  * gup
  * git wtf
  * git-scribe gen

==== Things to learn

  * Explore plugin, how do I use this better
  * motions `:help motion.txt`
  * text objects
  * autocmd

==== Tips

  * `dvf char` - delete up to char
  * `df char` - delete up to and including the char
  * `:windo e` - Refresh all window
  * `gggqG` - Reformat all lines in the file

==== Customisations

  * `:hi Search ctermbg=red` - Change the colour of search highlights
  * `set colorcolumn=140` - set the column limit to 140
  * `set textwidth=140` - set the text width to 140 characters

==== Snippets

  * Cucumber
  ** I'm forever having to type `save_and_open_page` for debugging
  * ruby
  ** `source :rubygems`
  ** `gem 'foo'`
