==== tmux-powerline

So I have powerline setup for vim but wouldn't it be nice if this was also setup for my terminal. With tmux-powerline
this is possible.

install latest bash
  * need the latest version of bash
    
  brew install bash

install tmux powerline
  * fork and customise
  ** probably a better way of doing this

install tmux-color-solarized
  * used for colour scheme

customise tmux.conf
  * tweak status bar
  ** document new layout

update .zshrc
  * doc tweaks

NOTE: git diff --cached b5f6be3..a2e8a28 in my dotfiles
NOTE: git diff --cached in my customised version of tmux-powerline
NOTE: Add screenshot of current setup
NOTE: move customised settings and scripts into their own directory
