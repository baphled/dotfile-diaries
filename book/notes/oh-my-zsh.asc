Firstly I love VIM, so I want my key bindings whilst using zsh, this
appears to be as easy as adding `set -o vi` in your `~/.zshrc` file.

I'm sure there are more things that you can do to get all of vi niceness
but doing this alone gives up the basics, which we can build upon as we
tweak our setup.
