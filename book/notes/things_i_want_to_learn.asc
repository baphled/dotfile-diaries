=== Things I want to learn

I need to improve the understanding of Bash and make more use of the Linux
utility commands (ack, sed, xargs) Improve my productivity with Vim.

=== Move most of my workflow to the console.

Pretty much most of my work can be done via the terminal. To help reduce
context swtiching, I'd prefer to have a setup that allows to to stick to the
terminal and alert me when information (emails, tweets, etc) is coming in

=== Lynx

Gettings around with lynx, saving bookmarks, organising them and all
that jazz
