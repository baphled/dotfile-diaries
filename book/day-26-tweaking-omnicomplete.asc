==== Tweaking omnicomplete

Since I tweaked omnicomplete I've noticed that it can be quite slow, especially when one of my open buffers has long
strings in the content. I'd like to tweak this so that I don't have to wait for omnicomplete to parse these long string
which is one of the pains I am not fond of at all.

I'll have a look at `neocomplecache` which cache words in my buffer and uses that to populate my omnicomplete lists.
This though may well use more memory that the previous solutions I've used but I won't really know how much so until I
actually start using it. Though this seems like a relatively sane idea for improving the speed in which omnicomplete
finds long strings.
