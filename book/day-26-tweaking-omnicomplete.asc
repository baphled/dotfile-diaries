==== Reviewing omnicomplete

Since I tweaked omnicomplete I've noticed that it can be quite slow, especially when one of my open buffers has long
strings in the content. I'd like to tweak this so that I don't have to wait for omnicomplete to parse these long string
which is one of the pains I am not fond of at all.

I'll have a look at `neocomplecache` which cache words in my buffer and uses that to populate my omnicomplete lists.
This though may well use more memory that the previous solutions I've used but I won't really know how much so until I
actually start using it. Though this seems like a relatively sane idea for improving the speed in which omnicomplete
finds long strings.

There is one thing that I need to look out for and that is that noecomplcache caches content so the long strings I'm
currently having issues with maywell cause my machines to slow down as noecomplcache attempts to retrieve data from the
cache.

As there are a few unknowns I need to checkout I'll hold out on setting neocomplecache right now and leave it for
another day once I have gone through the rest of the currently installed plugins.
