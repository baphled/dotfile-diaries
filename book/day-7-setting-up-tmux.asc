=== Setting up tmux

I already have tmux installed at present, though there will be a point when I
start my dotfiles anew and will properly document the process.

For now I want to focus on how to automatically spawn a tmux session along with
the default windows I use on a day to day basic.

I'm using tmux along with tmuxinator to help manage my setting.

Installing tmux is done simply by call `brew install tmux` once this has been installed we are ready to play with tmux. As I mentioned I'm using tmuxinator which is a ruby gem so we'll add that to our Gemfile:

    gem 'tmuxinator'

Running `bundle install` will install tmuxinator and then we are good to go.

Tmuxinator stores it's configuration settings in the `~/.tmuxinator` directory
but we can create a new setup my running `mux create workbench`. I've already
done this so I just ran `mux open workbench` to open the file in vim.

==== The layout

What I want here is a single session that setups up my perfect setup, allowing
me to make the most of my terminal.

For this I'd like the following windows:

* Workbench

I'm often scawling notes of some kind so having a window to allow me to work
with vim. So I want a window (Workbench) where I can interact with files via
vim and have access to the console. This is where most of my actually work is
done.

* IRC

I still want to be able to communicate with others and get topical information
so I will want to use the irssi setup I've setup to allow me to keep my
communications centralised.

* Spyhole

Tmux allows you to capture terminal output, I'd like to have a window that
tails the log file and display any captured content. With tmux's copy and paste
functionality will can easily pull out captured content and use it in other
places.

* Email

I still need my emails so having a window for that that I can quickly jump to
when I feel to would be idea, Mutt is pretty lightweight and I'm sure I can set
it up so automatically check for new emails, though procmail.

* Control Centre

I like to know if there are any changes that to my dotfiles master branch,
ideally this should be a panel in a window, for now this is be another stand
alone window that periodically calls `git wtf` to check for changes.

* Toybox

I like o have a ruby repl that I can play around with and test out ideas. I've
been playing around with pry a bit recently so I'd like to have a window open
that allows me to test out ideas before I hack away at a solution.

* Interwepts

As we have irssi setup to open a browser, we setup this window so that irssi
can open w3m for us.

==== The setup

Now I know what I want in regards of session setup, lets open up my workbench
config file and make this set up, all we need to do is update of config and
fire up the new session.

==== My config

  project_name: workbench
  project_root: ~/
  rvm: 1.9.2-head@workbench
  pre: cd ~/ && bundle
  tabs:
    - Workbench:
        layout: b147,208x73,0,0[208x62,0,0,208x10,0,63{104x10,0,63,103x10,105,63}]
        panes:
          - vim
          - #empty, will just run plain zsh
    - Interwepts: w3m http://google.com
    - IRC: irssi
    - Email: mutt
    - Spyhole: tail -f ~/workbench.log
    - "Dotfile Diaries": vi ~/Documents/Diary
    - 'Control centre': git wft
    - Toybox: be pry

Now with this setup, we can simple run `mux workbench` and tmuxinator will
handle the rest, creating and setting up each of my desired windows along with their separate tasks :)

I won't go into detail about my mappings and my config, as it can be
https://github.com/baphled/dotfiles/blob/master/.tmux.conf[here], and I'd like
to leave a broader explaination when I starting tinkering with `~/tmux.conf`.

==== TODO

  * Make sure that my workbench gemset is created
  * Open w3m with a better default
