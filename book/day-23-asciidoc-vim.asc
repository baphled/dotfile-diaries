I've been using asciidoc to write this diary.

As I use vim for my editor of choice I wanted a plugin that would
highlight the asciidoc syntax for me asciidoc-vim allows gives me just
that, making it easier to view asciidoc based content with nice syntax
highlighting.

It doesn't come with any snippets which would be cool but I guess that's
not much of a problem as I can always create my own. For the moment it's
enough just having syntax highlighting so I'll leave the creating custom
snippets for another time.
