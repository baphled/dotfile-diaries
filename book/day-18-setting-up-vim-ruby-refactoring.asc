=== Setting up vim-refactoring

So I've seens some of the mapping for vim-refactoring and it seems like
something I'd like to play around with.

Firstly I'll start by adding 'vim-refactoring' to dotfiles.

  git submodule add git://github.com/ecomba/vim-ruby-refactoring.git bundle/vim-ruby-refactoring

With this installed I was ready to use it. There are a few mappings I want to
focus on and then I'll make a note of those mappings I'd like ot learn at a
later stage.

'vim-refactoring' has some lengthly mapping but they turn out to be quite useful too.

  * `<leader>rit` - Replaces a temporary variable with a direct method or call
  * `<leader>rcpc` - Refactor Convert Post Conditional
  * `<leader>rec` - Refactor Extract Constant
  * `<leader>rel` - Refactor Extract Let
  * `<leader>relv` - Refactor Extract Local Variable
  * `<leader>rrlv` - Refactor Rename Local Variable
  * `<leader>rriv` - Refactor Rename Instance Variable
  * `<leader>rem` - Refactor Extract Method

I'll spend the next few weeks commiting these to my muscle memory.
