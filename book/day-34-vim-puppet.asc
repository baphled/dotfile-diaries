==== vim-puppet

Another file type plugin that I use for managing puppet files.

It comes with all the basic stuff the other file type plugins come with:

 * syntax highlighting
 * automatic alignment
 ** This uses Align to help with alignment
 * snippets
 ** A list of snippets can be found [here](https://github.com/rodjek/vim-puppet/blob/master/snippets/puppet.snippets)

There aren't any mappings added for this plugin but that is fine for the moment, if/when I discover I need such a thing
I'll create my own.
