==== vim-powerline

Powerline is a nice little plugin that tweakings the styling of your status bar, which also helps in pinning down which
buffer is active when you have multiple buffers open.

NOTE: Add screenshot of plugin.

To display the glyphs used by the plugin I'll need to add a patchd font. I'll need to install 'fontforge' to install the
patched font so 'brew' to the rescue.

NOTE: This may take some time.

	brew install fontforge

Once fontforge was installed I tried to install the patched font.

	fontforge -script ~/dotvim/bundle/powerline/fontpatcher/fontpatcher Anonymous\ Pro.ttf

Everything seemed to of installed find and I had setup the correct setting but I still couldn't view the glyphs. So for
now I'll put a fork in this tweak and move on.
