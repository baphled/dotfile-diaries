==== vim-powerline

Powerline is a nice little plugin that tweakings the styling of your status bar, which also helps in pinning down which
buffer is active when you have multiple buffers open.

NOTE: Add screenshot of plugin.

To display the glyphs used by the plugin I'll need to add a patchd font. I'll need to install 'fontforge' to install the
patched font so 'brew' to the rescue.

NOTE: Add link to patched font

NOTE: This may take some time.

	brew install fontforge

I also needed to add a new directory

	mkdir ~/.fonts

Once fontforge was installed I tried to install the patched font.

	fontforge -script ~/dotvim/bundle/powerline/fontpatcher/fontpatcher Anonymous\ Pro.ttf
	mv anonymous+Pro-Powerline-Powerline.ttf ~/.fonts/


Everything seemed to of installed fine: and I had setup the correct setting. So for now I'll put a fork in this tweak and
move on.

  sudo fc-cache -vf

This clears fontpatcher's cache, once that is done we just have to add the following snippet to my `.vimrc`

  let g:Powerline_symbols = 'fancy'
