==== Reinstalling my dotvim plugins

Now I have a list of the plugins I had from when I was using braid. Now I'll
use this list to reinstall my plugins and get my dotfiles up to date.

Here's a list of all my plugins that I currently have installed.

  ack.vim 
  asciidoc-vim 
  autocomplpop 
  ctrlp 
  cucumber 
  delimitMate 
  endwise 
  fugitive 
  jasmine 
  json 
  nerdcommenter 
  pastie 
  rails 
  snipmate 
  surround 
  syntastic 
  unimpaired 
  vagrant 
  vim-abolish 
  vim-bundler 
  vim-coffee-script 
  vim-conque 
  vim-gist 
  vim-indentobject 
  vim-powerline 
  vim-puppet 
  vim-ragtag 
  vim-rake 
  vim-ruby-block-conv 
  vim-ruby-refactoring 
  vim-ruby-sinatra 
  vim-rvm 
  vim-snipmate-ruby-snippets 
  vim-tabular 
  vim-textobj-rubyblock 
  vim-textobj-user 
  vimerl 
  vividchalk 
  webapi-vim 
  vim-pathogen 

Later on I will focus on these plugins and learn and use them better. Ideally I should
have a clean slate to improve my vi foo. For the moment though I will just add
them using git submodule and deal with stripping them down later.
