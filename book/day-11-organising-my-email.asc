==== Organising my email

So like most I get quite a lot of email, varying in importance and
relevance dependant on time. I'd like to get my old setup back in place
with a few tweaks. Things are pretty much configured so that my email
will be sent to the correct file but I need to improve on these recipes
so that I don't have to keep going back and forth over a long period of
time constantly tweaking it.

There are a few groups I know I'll need and as time goes by I will have
to add the odd new recipe but for now I'll focus on my personal email
and how to get that under some order.

NOTE: Link to my first procmailrc

As with others I get quite a lot from various services, these can be
filtered more as time goes on but for now I'd like a dumping ground
`social` which will store all the unmatched emails that may slip through
procmails net.

I also like to not see email regarding jobs/roles I'm not interested in.
Emails that have a given type of subject or come from know offenders
(crappy recruitment consultants) should be sent to `/dev/null` so that I
don't have to bother with them. This may need some tweaking but I think
testing my recipes by dry running it against my main email address
should help to get this refined relatively quickly

I also need a new directory to be created for any discussion groups I
have joined. The idea here is that these will be caught by procmail and
the name of the file will be created based on this. This way I don't
have to meddle with procmailrc too much and keeps things nice a clean.

===== Mailing lists

First things was to create a dummy email.

To do a dry run on my recipes I used the following command:

  procmail VERBOSE=on DEFAULT=/dev/null   \
    LOGFILE=~/test.log                    \
      ~/.procmailrc < ~/emailtest.txt

So the first thing I need to do is setup my social related email file.

----
  :0
  * ^((List-Id|X-(Mailing-)?List):(.*[<]\/[^>]*))
  {
      LISTID=$MATCH

      :0:
      * LISTID ?? ^\/[^@\.]*
      $MATCH

  }
----

From time to time I find myself on a MAJADOMO mail server so I'll add
this in to preempt these occasions.

----
  # MAJORDOMO - Automagically handle Majordomo lists
  :0
  * ^Sender: owner-[^@]+@[^@\+]+
  * ^Sender: owner-\/[^@\+]+
  {
      :0:
      $MATCH
  }
----

After doing a dry run the following directory was automatically added to
my Mail directory.

  Î» l Mail
  total 3187
  -rw-------   1 baphled  staff      3187 19 Jul 20:24 FooBar-list 

Now the problem here is that mutt does not recognise the directory and I
will have to still manually add each one as I notice them into my mutt
file.

There is a way around this I could make mutt smarter and work out which
directories are inboxes and which are not.

NOTE: Wrote a script that can easily list the inboxes. Need to automate

===== Filtering LinkedIn Discussion groups

Now I'm on a few LinkedIn mailing lists and they don't adear to the
above rules so I will need to create a generic rule that sends all
LinkedIn originating emails to the appropriate discussion group.

Getting the regexp just right wasn't easy but I finally manage to get it
to work with a little help from the shell.

I took the same route as I did earlier, copied a same email to the
emailtest.txt file, after a while I came up with the following.

  :0: # Change this so that it sorts by the digest group$
  * ^(From):(\/.*).*\<group-digests@linkedin.com\>$
  `echo $MATCH | awk '{$NF=`}1' | sed 's/ //g'`$''`

The most cryptic is the following line:

  `echo $MATCH | awk '{$NF=`}1' | sed 's/ //g'`$''`

Basically I echo the matched address out to the shell which then returns
everything but the last column, in this case it's the email address. It
then removes all spaces and we have our directory.

===== Filter PR crap

I'm still getting quite a bit of email dumped into my main inbox. I want
to fix this so that I don't have to waid through heaps of PR related
stuff I'm not really interested in.

This will be my dumping ground for emails I'm not likely to really read.

NOTE: Improve the readability of the next few paragraphs.

Anything that has 'offers' in the email address are the first to go.
GoDady use this account a bit so they'll be the first ones to go. Then
next work would be 'campaign' this wreaks of PR type stuff I'm not
really interested in. Another keyword would be 'discount' if you you
have this in your email address I more than like never see your email ;)

It seems that people actually use a 'marketing' account so again this
will be put in the same inbox as others above.

Below is a list of nasty PR words I'd like to throw into this inbox:

  * offers
  * campaign
  * discount
  * marketing
  * sale
  * sell

===== 3rd party services

There are a few services I use to maintain my sites and code. I want to
be able a basic recipe that stores all the account summary related
emails in one place so that they aren't stored in my inbox.

  * newrelic
  * godaddy
  * heroku
  * code school
  * peepcode
  * railscast
  * destroy all software
  * pragprog

===== Inept Recruitment filter

I really don't like having my email account filled with numerous emails
from recruitment agents regarding roles I will never consider. This list
will start to become overwheling if I just make a list of agencies that
are reknowned for not doing a good job. So I will start off by composing
a list of keywords that will help me solve this problem.   

So the list goes as follows:

  * PHP
  * Drup
  * Perl
  * VB
  * .Net
  * Javascript

===== Social

This will be where all my social gumph goes, mainly things like facebook
and random LinkedIn stuff etc.

  * facebook in general
  * LinkedIn stuff not caught earlier


For the curious
https://raw.github.com/baphled/dotfiles/e92354e25054921e562b1b038a53d35042da16cb/.procmailrc[here]
is a list of my basic recipes that I ended ip settling with for the time
being.

===== TODO

  * Filter emails via my address book
  * lower case To and From results
  * Improve my 3rd party filter
  * HTML based emails can be a pain in mutt so I'd be cool if I can view
    these without having to sift throught HTML.
