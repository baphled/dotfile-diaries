=== Carry on where I left off

It's been annoying me for a while but I have dealt with the pain up until now.
When I close a buffer and revisit it I'd like to have the cursor placed exactly
where I left it when I closed the file. For some reason this functionality
doesn't come out of the box but it does tell you how to do it.

  augroup vimrcEx
    autocmd BufReadPost *
      \ if line("'\"") > 0 && line("'\"") <= line("$") |
      \   exe "normal g`\"" |
      \ endif
  augroup vimrcEx

Now when I close a file and open it again the cursor will be positioned where
it was when I closed it.
