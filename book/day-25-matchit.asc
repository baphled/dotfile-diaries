Matchit pretty much does what it says on the tin. It matches the begining and
the end of blocks of texts/code and allows you to use mappings to easily move
from either side. This can be quite useful whilst programming and wanting to
move from the begining of a condition or element to the end. 

 * `%` - Cycle forward through matching groups
 * `g%`- Cycle backwards through matching groups
 * `[%`- Go to [count] previous unmatched group
 * `]%`- Go to [count] next unmatched group

This plugin is also used by a few of my other plugins also so I'll be keeping
this for the time being and getting to grips with these key bindings.

NOTE: Add list of plugins that rely on matchit.
