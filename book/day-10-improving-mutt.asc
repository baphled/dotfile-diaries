=== Improving mutt

So I have my GMail account setup but that's not enough. I want to include all
my personal email accounts and maintain them.

This will include processing my mail and sending/creating subdirectories based
on a single emails content.

=== Ingredients

  * procmail
  * mutt
  * fetchmail
  * msmtp

Procmail and fetchmail are installed on Macs by default so that saves me a
step, so I guess the next things is to create some mail recipes.

So I'll have to run the following to get the ball rolling:
  
  brew install msmtp

I then had to add the following to my `.zshrc`

  MAIL=/home/baphled/mail/inbox && export MAIL

Then  in my home directory I ran:

  touch .fetchmailrc
  chmod 700 .fetchmailrc

I then needed to poll my main email account 
  poll mail.my-email-account.net with proto POP3
    user 'EMAILADDRESS' keep
    mda '/usr/bin/procmail -d %T'

I put my credentials in my `.netrc` file as follows:

  machine mail.my-email-accoun.net
  login my-username
  password my-password

I had to make sure that I had setup my email details properply and to do this I
had to do the following:

  fetchmail

Once everything was setup properly fetchmail did it's things and retrieved my
email. This is the bare minimum I need to make sure that I have procmail
working so that I can store my email in the right directories. 

I need to then create the mail directory `~/Mail` which is where all my mail
will end up.

=== Recipes

So now I need to sort my emails into separate files so that I can deal with
them easily.

For this I'll be using procmail and its' recipes to determine where emails
should.

NOTE: Add my basic recipes here

I'd also like to make fetchmail get my latest mail via mutt and not via a
background process, this is quite easy with the follwoing macro:

  macro generic G \
    <shell-escape>'fetchmail'<enter> \
    'Run fetchmail'

NOTE: Need to document how to setup mail directories

Now I need to be able to move around my filtered directories easily. To do this
I can add a couple of macros to allow me to do just this.

NOTE: Add macros for selecting mail directories

I'd also like to have a split screen so that I can see both the email I'm
reading as well as the list of emails in mail directory I am currently in.

=== TODO

  * Create generic recipes for project messages and the like
  * Setup vim like bindings
  * Move all email related config files into one repository
  * Setup multiple accounts
  * Each account should have its own default directory
