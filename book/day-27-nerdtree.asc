==== Nerdtree

I've touched on Nerdtree in a previous entry, mainly to setup the basics to get me going but I'll go over some of the
fundermentals of Nerdtree and why I have decided to go back to using it.

Though 'netrw' is quite useful I still needed ways of managing files (create, delete, name). This wasn't possible with
'netrw' and though I could map `!rm %` and the other Unix commands, this grows old quick and needs at least 3 mappings
per command. Nerdtree allowed me to do this quite nicely and although I still have `Ctrl-P` to find files I is still
useful to have a file draw to visually display your projects file structure. 

One of the first things I am currently missing is an easy way to open Nerdtree with the current file selected. This
comes in handy when I need to rename or remove a file.

NOTE: Instructions on how to highlight a file in Nerdtree.

I mentioned in link::day-19-tweaking-nerdtree.asc[Tweaking Nerdtree] `<C-p>` is used to toggle Nerdtrees view. Nerdtree
has a host of commands that you can play with, they are easily viewed by pressing `?` within the Nerdtree buffer. I'll
simply go over the ones I use the most below:

 * `p` - jump to the parent directory
 * `P` - go to the root directory
 * `o` - open and close a directory
 * `x` - close and close a directory
 * `X` - recursively close and close a directory
 * `C` - Make the current directory to the tree root
 * `I` - Display hidden files

These commands I tend to use the most especially when I need to create and/or manage files:

 * `m` - show menu
 ** `m` - rename node
 ** `c` - copy node
 ** `a` - add node

A node is basically a file or directory, to specify a directory you simply need to add a forward slash ('/').

Nerdtree support a few other features that I don't really use at present, bookmarking directories could be quite useful
but opening files in different tabs isn't something I'm fond off.
