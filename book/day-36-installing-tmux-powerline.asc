==== Installing tmux-powerline

homepage: http://github.com/erikw/tmux-powerline

Today I want to put some time aside to customise my terminal a little bit more. The one thing that has come to my
attension recently is `tmux-powerline`.

NOTE: Display image of my status bar before setting up `tmux-powerline`

The generic tmux status bar is ok but I prefer a little bit more control and flexibility as to what is shown there and
how. This is where `tmux-powerline` is cool. I'd like to have quite a bit of information accessible to me at a glance so
the ideal setup for me will tell me the following things:

 * The machine I am currently working from
 * My IP addresses
 * What tmux pain and session I am currently in
 * Emails I have unopen
 * Battery status
 * Git
 ** Branch I am currently on
 ** Need to pull
 ** Need to push
 * List of sessions

===== Installing

Initially I just threw everything together and dumped tmux-powerline and the solarized theme into my home directory. I
don't particularly like this and create a tmux repository.

So firstly I've had to fork my own version of `tmux-powerline` mainly so that I could quickly customise my own status
bar but also to that I can add some extra functionality to the tool later on down the road when I get some playtime.

I'll be creating a new directory called `tmux` which will store all my tmux customisations. That include the tmux
solarized theme and my tmux configuration file. I'll then symlink `.tmux.conf` to my new repository.

  git init
  git submodule add git@github.com:baphled/tmux-powerline.git powerline
  mv ~/.tmux.conf tmux.conf
  ln -s tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf

===== Customisation

The main changes needed where to disable the right status bar fully so my panel list can live there and to include and
customise the left bar, where I'd like most of my information to be stored.

I made a quite a few tweaks to my tmux conf file which you can see
http://github.com/baphled/tmuxfiles/blob/c933919bb3c2cc4eb904c7d101524cacdeff2ee7/tmux.conf[here].

I don't really want to use the right side status bar at the moment, though this may change at some point down the road.
So I want to make sure that the right side status bar doesn't display, I do this by making the status empty.

The one things that annoys me about the current state of `tmux-powerline` is that the status bars generally need to be
customised but there is no real way of doing this at the moment without having to fork the project and make it my own.
This is cool and everything but keeping things up to date can become a pain.

So in this case I'm going create my own status file, basically copying my current left statusbar and move it to my
repository.

===== The final step

The first two parts of my customised status bar are actually done by hand, though it was a cool things to work out at
the time I should create what `tmux-powerline` calls segments. There is already one to display the session name and pane
number but I want to customise it to look like how I currently have it.

As I already have a forked version of the repository it is easy enough to make this change and remove prerolled version.
Before I do that though I should add a segment for displaying my current username.

Now I have powerline setup for both tmux and vim :)
