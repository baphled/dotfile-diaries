=== Dotfiles with some Raspbian Pi

Today I had to install my dotfiles on a new system. These are the steps I needed to take.

Firstly I had to remove `.bashrc` as I already have a copy in my dotfiles. I did this with the following command.

  rm .bashrc

Once that was complete I had to run the following commands to pull down my dotfiles and get the updated locally.

  git init
  git add remote origin git://github.com/baphled/dotfiles.git
  git pull && git submodule init && git submodule update && git submodule status
  git submodule foreach --recursive git submodule update --init 

NOTE: I'm sure there is a cleaner way to do this but it seems to do the trick for now.

As Raspbian doesn't have zsh install by default I had to install it my self.

  sudo apt-get install zsh

As my dotfiles require `rvm` to display the gemset I am currently working in.

  curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby

Once the installation process completed rvm was install and I was free to set zsh as my default shell.

The final step is to update my shell to zsh instead of bash.

  chsh -s /bin/zsh

This will prompt for a password and once authorised the change will become perminent.
