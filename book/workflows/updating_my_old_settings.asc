=== Updating my old machine with my new dotfiles

So today is a little bit of a detour but I wanted to get this down for getting
my other machines to make use of my new settings.

Firstly I tried to do a simple update but because of the change from 'braid' to
'git submodule' that wasn't possible. So the alternative was to remove my old
settings and `.git/config`.

  rm -rf .git dotvim oh-my-zsh .gitconfig .gitignore

That removed all the files that related to my custom setings and allowed me to
start a fresh pretty quickly. As there is no way to clone my dotfiles directly.
I had to take the follwoing steps.

  git init
  git add remote origin git@github.com/baphled/dotfiles.git
  git pull origin master

Once this was complete I still had to get the submodules updated so that everything was nicely setup.

  git submodule update --init

Now I'm sure that there is a better way of doing this but as my dotvim
repository also has submodules I need to run the same command as above within
that directory to make sure that everything was up to date.

  cd ~/dotvim
  git submodule update --init

This took some time so it's a perfect time to take a break.
