=== Ruby projects

So the first project workflow i'll capture is ruby projects there are a couple
of ingredients to this recipe which go as follows:

  * vim
  * pry running the applications environemnt
  * the version of ruby

  project_name: PROJECT_NAME
  project_root: PROJECT_PATH
  rvm: RUBY_VERSION@PROJECT_NAME
  pre: cd PROJECT_PATH && bundle && gup
  tabs:
    - Workbench:
        layout: b147,208x73,0,0[208x62,0,0,208x10,0,63{104x10,0,63,103x10,105,63}]
        panes:
          - vim
          - #empty, will just run plain zsh
    - Server: rackup
    - "Ruby Docs": w3m http://http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-RUBY_VERSION/
    - Spyhole: tail -f ~/workbench.log
    - "Project Summary": g wtf
    - Toybox: be pry -r config.ru

NOTE: Add a basic breakdown of what the config file actually does.

So I'll need a script that takes the following arguements:

  * project name
  * project path
  * ruby version

The first thing to do is create a new directory, this will be where all my tmux
workflow templates will be stored. I then copied the above code into a file
called 'ruby-project.yml' which will be used to create my ruby based sesssion.

I then hacked together a script called 'setup_project' as a ruby script to
basically do all the leg work for me.

The script basically takes a git repo and clones the repository. It then try to
work out what version of ruby is needed and creates a new gemset. Once this is
complete I manipulate the skeletion yaml file and copies it into my tmuxinator
directory. Now I'm ready to call the session and get to working.

=== Issues

  * Windows should be set to the projects direcory 

NOTE: Move the next 2 paragraphs to the workflows section

This script will be very basic to start of with and I will build it up as I
work through my various workflows.

Initially I only want it to make a few changes, as outlined earlier, then once
it is working for the basic workflows I'll gradually improve the script to
handle all my workflow needs.
