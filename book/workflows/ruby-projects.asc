=== Ruby projects

So the first project workflow i'll capture is ruby projects there are a couple
of ingredients to this recipe which go as follows:

  * vim
  * pry running the applications environemnt
  * the version of ruby

  project_name: PROJECT_NAME
  project_root: PROJECT_PATH
  rvm: RUBY_VERSION@PROJECT_NAME
  pre: cd PROJECT_PATH && bundle && gup
  tabs:
    - Workbench:
        layout: b147,208x73,0,0[208x62,0,0,208x10,0,63{104x10,0,63,103x10,105,63}]
        panes:
          - vim
          - #empty, will just run plain zsh
    - Server: rackup
    - "Ruby Docs": w3m http://http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-RUBY_VERSION/
    - Spyhole: tail -f ~/workbench.log
    - "Project Summary": g wtf
    - Toybox: pry

NOTE: Add a basic breakdown of what the config file actually does.

So I'll need a script that takes the following arguements:

  * project name
  * project path
  * ruby version

The first thing to do is create a new directory, this will be where all my tmux
workflow templates will be stored. I then copied the above code into a file
called 'ruby-project.yml' which will be used to create my ruby based sesssion.

I then hacked together a script called 'setup_project' as a ruby script to
basically do all the leg work for me.

The script basically takes a git repo and clones the repository. It then try to
work out what version of ruby is needed and creates a new gemset. Once this is
complete I manipulate the skeletion yaml file and copies it into my tmuxinator
directory. Now I'm ready to call the session and get to working.

The complete script can be found here, it basically does what I outlined above
and will be the basis of the other workflows that I decide to focus on.

The only I came across was the an issue with not being able to load pry with a
projects config. I'll look into this as a side issue and create a new issue to
address the changes.

Next, I'll do the same for rails projects.

==== TODO

  * Get pry to load my ruby projects
  * make sure pry is available regardless of the gemset and ruby version

NOTE: Move the next 2 paragraphs to the workflows section

This script will be very basic to start of with and I will build it up as I
work through my various workflows.

Initially I only want it to make a few changes, as outlined earlier, then once
it is working for the basic workflows I'll gradually improve the script to
handle all my workflow needs.
