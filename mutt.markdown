Taming the mutt
===============

I'd like to use mutt for dealing with my email, AppleMail is cool but
it's way too much for my liking and I'd prefer it if I could organise my
emails without having to fiddle with sub folders manually.

I my old config this was done by using procmail to create/send emails to
folders dependant on the source of the email.

This was pretty configurable so I'd like to get some of this back into
my current setup so that I don't get email overload :)
