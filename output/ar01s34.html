I know it
can open images and it can apparently open tabs but I have never played with
the former. It would be cool to work out how this happens so I can tell tmux to
open a new tab with a link when ever I feel. This way if I have a link copied
and can quickly trigger a tmux mapping and get it open a new tab in the
<span class="emphasis"><em>Interwepts</em></span> window :)</p><p>I have IRC setup but I still need to tweak it somewhat so that I can use it
more as I used to. One of the primary uses of IRC for me is using XDCC. On my
old windows machine I used to have a script that allowed me to gather a list of
interesting files to download and queue them up accordingly. It allowed me to
only download a certain amount of files at a time and move them to a completed
directory once each one had finished downloading. I’d like to replicate this in
irssi so that I don’t have to spend time finding content of interest and simply
choose what I want and forget about it.</p><p>I’ve been using bjurl and twirssi for a little bit now but I still don’t know
how to use it as productively as I know my GUI tools. Today and tomorrow will
be focused on getting to know these tool better and spending some time getting
the to work just as I would like to use them.</p><p>bjurl should be easy to tweak, I want to be able to keep track of as many URL’s
as possible without having to reset it or be quick enough to select a link to
view. I should simply be able to select one from what I see and not have to
deal with anything else.</p><p/></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s33.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s35.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Day 34 </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Day 36</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
