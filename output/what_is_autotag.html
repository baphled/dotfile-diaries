<a id="_what_is_autotag"></a>What is Autotag</h2></div></div></div>
<p>This has been breifly touch on when adding my
<a class="ulink" href=":/day_18.html#_adding_ctags" target="_top">ctags</a> though I haven’t really spoken about
what it actually does and what it’s benefits are.</p>
<p>Firstly, the first issue with updating ctags is that when running <code class="literal">ctags -a</code>
you’d only update the current tags list whilst not removing tags that are no
longer needed.</p>
<p>Autotag updates the ctags for a project everytime a file is saved. This is
needed so that my ctags don’t become stale and include definitions that are no
longer present in the project I am currently working on. Meaning that when
pressing <code class="literal">&lt;C-]&gt;</code> I only get results that are relevent to the project and don’t
have to sift through a load of useless results.</p>
<p>Autotag requires <span class="emphasis"><em>Python</em></span> support so it is important to have support for this
in my <span class="emphasis"><em>Vim</em></span>. Thankfully if my Vim doesn’t support <span class="emphasis"><em>Python</em></span> then it doesn’t not
fail horribly. These saves me from having to clear my tags manually and just
focus on the task at hand, writing code.</p>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a id="_syntastic"></a>Syntastic</h3></div></div></div>
<p>I use this to help me find syntax errors easily, it doesn’t do this on the fly
but I save often enough for that not to be a problem. All that is needed is for
a file to be saved and if any errors are found the quickbox buffer will open up
allowing for me to go over each change and deal with them appropriately.
Syntastic comes with a host of syntax checker and the basic to allow for me to
easily add more checkers dependent on the filetype I am dealing with.</p>
<p>It uses the built in Vim commands for navigation or errors <code class="literal">:lnext</code> and
<code class="literal">:lprev</code>. As I’m using unimpaired I have alternative mappings for these as follows:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<code class="literal">[l</code> - <code class="literal">:lnext</code>
</li>
<li>
<code class="literal">l]</code> - <code class="literal">:lprevious</code>
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>Other mime type related plugins also add their own checkers so I have pretty
much all the checkers I need for the moment. The following languages are
included out of the box. The following is just a few that are maintained that I am interest in:
 * yaml
 * jslint
 * jshint (gillesruppert)
 * sass
 * html (darcyparker)
 * coffee (darcyparker)
 * xml
 * xslt
 * less (irrationalfab)
 * puppet (frimik)
 * ruby
 * scss
 * json
 * cucumber
 * css
 * erlang</p>
<p>There is a range of other checkers that can be found
<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic/tree/master/syntax_checkers" target="_top">here</a>.</p>
<p>I tend not to use a host of these but at least I know they are there if they
are ever needed.</p>
