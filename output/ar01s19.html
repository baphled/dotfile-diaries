a new one with the same name. This will bork my <code class="literal">dotfile</code> repository submodule
but I can easily fix that by either updating the reference manually or removing
and reinstall the plugin via the command line.</p><p>Before I do this I want to move some of my settings around so that they can be
easily added or left out if I desire. My aim here is to make it easier to
choose the vim setup I prefer.</p><p>My initial setup will be a bare bones version of Vim with little to none
plugins added. As I gain more proficiency I will gradually add plugins to my
workflow to help enhance the keystokes I have already learnt. The first of
these will focus on text objects and then I will focus on movements and making
project wide changes.</p><p>I will stick with plugins that enhance the mime types available to me and help
with some basic formatting. Once I have this under my belt I will start to
delve into VIML and creating my own plugins and tweaks.</p><p>Whilst doing all this I will be picking up a Practical Vim tip a day to help me
productivity. These will generally be separate entries and will go over what
I’ve learnt and how the new skill could be used to improve how I work.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_cleaning_up_my_vim_settings"/>Cleaning up my vim settings</h3></div></div></div><p>So I’ve customised my vim settings quite a bit based on
<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/astrails/dotvim" target="_top">astrails dotvim</a> repository. My changes have
diverged quite abit and I’d rather break them from the branch and start a
fresh. This will lead the way for me stripping down my settings and finding
ways to easily get used to using vim without all the bells and whistles.</p><p>The first thing I need to do is detach from the origination repository and make
sure that my changes are kept in place. Once this is done I can then create a
config setting to not use and plugins and use a base set of configuration
settings so that I can start to improve my basic Vim skills.</p><p>I had to go to github and delete the repository. Once deleted I created a new
repository with the same name and push the repository</p><pre class="literallayout">git push</pre><p>I now have a repository that is not forked to astrails. I still need to let my
dotfiles know that the repository is update and has changed so I need to do the
following</p><pre class="literallayout">gup</pre><p>This detached the head of the repository, which is easy enough to fix, as long
as there are no local changes.</p><pre class="literallayout">g co master</pre><p>Now that the repository is up to date all I need to do is update my <code class="literal">dotfiles</code>
to reflect the changes to the detached repository.</p><pre class="literallayout">cd ~
ga dotvim
g ci -m 'Update my dotvim files'</pre><p>Now the repository is up to date and my dotfiles know of the change I’ve just
made.</p><p>Finally I push the change to my dotfiles and everything is all set.</p><p/></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s18.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s20.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Housekeeping tools </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Day 17</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
