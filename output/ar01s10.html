maintained. I’ll also come up with some ideas as to what my dotfiles will
include and how to maintain the core dependencies of them.</p><p>As some of the setup may change from box to box I shouldn’t have to throw
everything into once basket, my dotfiles, I’d like to build some scripts that
handle the dependencies of the setup and makes it easy for me to continue to
tweak it whilst allowing it to be setup on any box with ease.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_dotfile_blueprints"/>Dotfile blueprints</h3></div></div></div><p>So this is where the plan starts to come together.</p><p>My dotfiles should be a collection of settings and utilities that help me with
my day to day work. As time has gone on I’ve learnt what I like and what I
don’t and have always like the idea of having one group setting that can go
anywhere. Back in the day my setup was stored on my personal CVS repository,
these days its github.</p><p>NOTE:
This link will need to be changed when we start the new version or clean up the
current.</p><p>I already have my dotfiles <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/baphled/dotfiles" target="_top">here</a>.</p><p>So there are a few thins I’ll need my dotfiles to have, as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
I must be able to push changes to any of my dotfiles without adding them to
    my actual dotfiles, at present I’m having to do a lot of copy and pasting
</li><li>
It must be easy to update dependancies
</li><li>
Must be under version control
</li><li>
Should have a collection of custom scripts for things I do a lot of
</li><li>
This is start off by being a bunch of git scripts
</li><li>
Alert me if my dotfiles or their dependancies are out of date
</li><li>
I’ll start on doing this just for my other dotfiles (dotmutt, dotirssi, etc)
</li><li>
Create a script to install my dependancies
</li><li>
This will start of by focussing on installing things via brew
</li><li>
Should automatically check for new gems that my dotfiles rely on
</li><li>
Must include the applications that my dotfiles rely on
</li></ul></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_the_basics"/>The basics</h4></div></div></div><p>Let’s start from the top, I want the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
Vim
</li><li>
Tmux
</li><li>
ZSH
</li></ul></div><p>Regardless of what I’m aiming to do I’ll need all of these to make my workflow
as productive as possible.</p><p>I’ll need to branch my current repository so that I can start a fresh, once
this is done, the next thing to do will be to add the dependancies. I may look
into using puppet or chef for this but if that is the case then I will want to
make sure that my dotfiles knows how to do a <code class="literal">bundle install</code>.</p><p>So I guess the first thing will be to install rvm and get that setup so I can
setup ruby.</p><p>I should also document this process so that I can turn it into a script which
makes sure that I have the correct version of ruby and have run bundle.</p><p>So for zsh I’ll want to use <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/baphled/oh-my-zsh" target="_top"> oh-my-zsh </a>. I’ll use my own forked version, which
includes my custom theme, and will add it to my newly created dotfiles.</p><p>The main issue at the moment is that if I have made changes to my dotfiles or
any of their sub repositories I’d like the commit to got to the right
repository and not just be added to my dotfiles.</p><p>I’m not sure how easy it is to achieve this but this would be the ideal
situation for how I work. It very rare that I know the correct config or
commands or changes for the at matter from the get go and have to spend a
little time tinkering on my local setup before I can commit to anything. So
having to keep track of these changes and copy them to the specific repository
is a pain and error prone.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_resources_6"/>Resources</h4></div></div></div><p><a class="ulink" href="http://chrisjean.com/2009/04/20/git-submodules-adding-using-removing-and-updating" target="_top">git submodules</a>
