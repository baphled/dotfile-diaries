<p>It’s been annoying me for a while but I have dealt with the pain up until now.
When I close a buffer and revisit it I’d like to have the cursor placed exactly
where I left it when I closed the file. For some reason this functionality
doesn’t come out of the box but it does tell you how to do it.</p>
<pre class="literallayout">augroup vimrcEx
  autocmd BufReadPost *
    \ if line("'\"") &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; line("'\"") &lt;= line("$") |
    \   exe "normal g`\"" |
    \ endif
augroup vimrcEx</pre>
<p>Now when I close a file and open it again the cursor will be positioned where
it was when I closed it.</p>

<a id="_removing_some_pain"></a>Removing some pain</h3></div></div></div>
<p>I’ve been missing my snippets for a while now, I have snipmate installed
but I have limited snippets installed and setup.</p>
<p>To resolve this I’ll install <span class="emphasis"><em>snipmate-snippets</em></span> to start with. Once I
have had a play with those I will later create my own for snippets that
I feel is missing.</p>
<p>I’m actually going to fork this project so that I can keep my custom
snippets all in one place. That and I don’t want/need all the other
snippets that come with the original version.</p>
<p>The version I chose was relatively new and included snippets for
jasmine and a range of ruby snippets, which was a plus.</p>
<pre class="literallayout">http://github.com/honza/snipmate-snippets</pre>
<p>Once forked I added my custom fork.</p>
<pre class="literallayout">git submodule add git://github.com/baphled/snipmate-snippets.git bundle snipmate-snippets</pre>
<p>I will need to remove <span class="emphasis"><em>vim-snipmate-ruby-snippets</em></span></p>
<p>I need to remove the instance from <span class="emphasis"><em>.gitmodules</em></span></p>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
<p>Add lines I had to remove in my .gitmodules file</p>
</div>
<pre class="literallayout">rm -rf ../.git/modules/dotvim/modules/bundle/vim-snipmate-ruby-snippets</pre>
<pre class="literallayout">g ci -m 'update snippets'</pre>
<p>Updates my dotvims and includes the new snippets plugin.</p>
<p>I’d like to build up on these and strip them down for my own needs. This will
more than likely include writing my own where there are missing shortcuts I’d
like.</p>
<p>I also need to learn the snippets that are present. The only way to actually do
this is to actually use them. The best type of snippet are the ones that just
rolls off of your fingers. So I expect there to be snippets for <span class="emphasis"><em>def</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>class</em></span>,
<span class="emphasis"><em>desc</em></span>, etc. As I also do quite a bit of writing in Vim I’d like to make sure I
know that AsciiDoc and Markdown snippets.</p>
<p>At the moment my forked version doesn’t have any snippets for AsciiDoc so I
will have to search for some and merge them into my version and updated my
submodules.</p>
<p>It seems that I am getting warnings about snippets already being defined. I
need to look into this to see how I can supress the messages and stop them from
happening all together.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a id="_tweaking_snipmate"></a>Tweaking snipmate</h3></div></div></div>
<p>So the current version of snipmate I already contains some snippets which are
causing me to see warnings. This can be resolved by changing the repository
I pull from with a version of snipmate that doesn’t include any snippets.</p>
<p>I’ll omit removing the actual module as it has been documented already and jump
straight into adding the new repository.</p>
<pre class="literallayout">git submodule add git://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate.git bundle/vim-snipmate</pre>
<pre class="literallayout">git submodule add git://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-mw-utils.git bundle/vim-addon-mw-utils</pre>
<p>Now we have no warnings and we have a nice base to start adding custom snippets
the only issue is when I &lt;TAB&gt; I get an error stating I need tlib to be
installed. That’s a bit of of red herring as we actually need tlib-vim.</p>
<pre class="literallayout">git submodule add git://github.com/tomtom/tlib_vim.git bundle/tlib-vim</pre>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
<p>Add some of the shortcuts here.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a id="_improving_buffer_navigation"></a>Improving buffer navigation</h3></div></div></div>
<p>So I’d like to be able to navigatie and maintain my buffers in a cleaner
manner, I’ve seen bufexplorer but never had a chance to play around with it.
This is the time to get it setup and working to see how it fairs with my
current setup.</p>
<pre class="literallayout">git submodule add git://github.com/c9s/bufexplorer.git bundle/bufexplorer</pre>
<p>Finally I just need to map BufExplorer to a custom mapping to make things a
little easier.</p>
<pre class="literallayout">noremap &lt;leader&gt;. :BufExplorer&lt;CR&gt;</pre>
<p>And that’s all there is to it. I can now view my buffers using <code class="literal">&lt;leader&gt;.</code> and
manage the buffers easier with a few shortcut keys.</p>
