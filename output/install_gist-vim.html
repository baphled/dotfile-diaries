<a id="_install_gist_vim"></a>Install gist-vim</h2></div></div></div>
<p>As I don’t have this installed for some reason and I’m due to starting
reviewing my vim packages, I thought I’d start with gist-vim. I tend to need to
post gists quickly and I usually end up using vim to write these notes and
snippets.</p>
<p>The only problem with this is that I have to go find the file and then copy and
paste the contents via the website. That’s kinda slow and annoying. I’ve used
gist-vim in the past so it’s time to get that setup and running so that I can
send my gists easier.</p>
<p>Same as usual I start by install the plugin:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">git submodule add git://github.com/mattn/gist-vim.git bundle/gist-vim</pre>
<p>I also need <code class="literal">webapi-vim</code> which deal with the API calls to github. As I don’t
need to install it, as it’s already installed I’ll gloss over how it was
installed as it is just a case of adding the plugin and forgetting about it.</p>
<p>My <code class="literal">plugin.vim</code> doesn’t have any settings for <code class="literal">gist-vim</code> so I’ll add them now
and then go over the basic commands I’ll need to play around with gist via vim.</p>
<p>I want to be able to copy snippets from a gist:
  let g:gist_clip_command = <span class="emphasis"><em>pbcopy</em></span></p>
<p>I also want to try to detect the file type gists should be when uploading them:
  let g:gist_detect_filetype = 1</p>
<p>The default command is <code class="literal">:Gist</code> and <code class="literal">:'&lt;,'&gt;Gist</code> with the following flags for
the various options:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<code class="literal">-p</code> - a private gist
</li>
<li>
<code class="literal">-P</code> - a public gist
</li>
<li>
<code class="literal">-m</code> - save a gist with all the buffers
</li>
<li>
<code class="literal">-e</code> - edit the gist in the current buffer
</li>
<li>
<code class="literal">-d</code> - delete a gist
</li>
<li>
<code class="literal">-l</code> - list my gists
</li>
<li>
<code class="literal">-l username</code> - list a users gists
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>I could map a few of these commands but I’ll hold off on that for the moment
and just get accustomed to calling it manually.
=== Reviewing vim-pastie</p>
<pre class="literallayout">Name:   gist-vim
Source: http://github.com/mattn/gist-vim
Repo:   git://github.com/mattn/gist-vim.git</pre>
<p>I’ve had this installed pretty much from day one and never really used it. I
guess I typically store my notes in gists or evernotes. The latter I have not
got a plugin for, this will go on the <span class="emphasis"><em>to get</em></span> list.</p>
<p>Pastie basically does the same as gist-vim put post the content of a buffer(s)
to pastie.</p>
