that w3m can deal with tabs and images. Admittedly I’m not particularly
a fan of tabs, mainly as I tend to build up quite a collection of these
and never really go back to them, but I’ll give it a whirl and see what
the pros and cons of it as opposed to lynx.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_playing_with_w3m"/>Playing with w3m</h3></div></div></div><p>As always I used brew <code class="literal">brew install w3m</code> to get things rolling.</p><p>So this is what w3m looks like out of the box.</p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="https://github.com/baphled/dotfile-diaries/raw/master/screenshots/w3m-default.png" alt="default setup"/></span></p><p>Off the bat the colours are all wrong, trying to red blue text is near
impossible when using a black background, so that had to be changed.</p><p>The other issue was that though I still had my vim keys I could not use
<code class="literal">&lt;C-B&gt;</code> and <code class="literal">&lt;C-F&gt;</code> to move around, which is annoying, that’ll have to be
changed too.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>how do i change the binding?</p></div><p><a class="ulink" href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/MANUAL" target="_top">manual</a></p><p>I also couldn’t see URL’s at all.</p><p>I guess the first step is to work out how to customise w3m so that we
can get those colours sorted and give it some vim love.</p><p>Ok, so changing the settings is quite easy to get to, simply press <code class="literal">o</code>
whilst having w3m open and the settings page will be displayed. We
simple need to scroll down to <span class="emphasis"><em>Colour Settings</em></span> and specify the colours we desire.</p><p>Viewing links it’s just as easy as interacting with any other link so
that’s cool :)</p><p>The only things that niggles me is not being able to set up leader key</p><p>The most important once for the moment are to page up and down quickly
as the default mappings are quite a stretch.</p><p>Add the below to the keymap file within <code class="literal">~/.w3m</code> gives me the ability to
do exactly this.</p><pre class="literallayout">keymap  F     NEXT_PAGE
keymap  B     PREV_PAGE</pre><p>Now that w3m is setup a for navigating a little easier, I’ll swap out
lynx for w3m.</p><pre class="literallayout">/set browse_command tmux send-keys -t interwepts 'w3m $1' C-m</pre><p>We’ll run with this for the moment as see how it fairs.</p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="https://github.com/baphled/dotfile-diaries/raw/master/screenshots/w3m-current.png" alt="new setup"/></span></p><p>Before we commit this to version control, we’ll make some tweaks to the
config file to make it less specific to a Mac.</p><p>Below is a snippet from my config that I should change, when on a different
box, I probably won’t have brew installed and I prefer to have all my settings
controlled locally so we wont need the references to the skeleton configs.</p><pre class="literallayout">urimethodmap ~/.w3m/urimethodmap, /usr/local/Cellar/w3m/0.5.3/etc/w3m/urimethodmap
mailcap ~/.w3m/mailcap, /usr/local/Cellar/w3m/0.5.3/etc/w3m/mailcap
mime_types ~/.mime.types, /usr/local/Cellar/w3m/0.5.3/etc/mime.types</pre><p>It now looks like this:</p><pre class="literallayout">urimethodmap ~/.w3m/urimethodmap
mailcap ~/.w3m/mailcap
mime_types ~/.mime.types</pre><p>So now we’re pretty much ready to play around with it for a while and take
notes of things that I’d like to change.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_todo_2"/>TODO</h4></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>

it’s way too much for my liking and I’d prefer it if I could organise my
emails without having to fiddle with sub folders manually.</p><p>I my old config this was done by using procmail to create/send emails to
folders dependant on the source of the email.</p><p>This was pretty configurable so I’d like to get some of this back into
my current setup so that I don’t get email overload :)</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_setting_things_up"/>Setting things up</h4></div></div></div><p>I had a better setup a while back but after rummaging around for ancient backups I decided to start from scratch.</p><p>Again, I’ll be using brew to get mutt installed <code class="literal">brew install mutt</code></p><p>You’ll need to run the following commands:</p><pre class="literallayout">mkdir -p ~/.mutt/cache/headers
mkdir ~/.mutt/cache/bodies
touch ~/.mutt/certificates</pre><p>Next I needed to create a <code class="literal">.muttrc</code> file, to setup my GMail account. I
used this example
<a class="ulink" href="http://github.com/baphled/dotmutt/raw/master/muttrc" target="_top">here</a> to get things
started.</p><p>I had to make a few tweaks to get things just right. Firstly the order
of the emails were newest at the bottom which is kind of annoying, I’d
like to see my newest emails first, so this needs to be sorted.</p><p>We’ll hold out on that for the moment and customise the look of mutts, I
stumbled upon
<a class="ulink" href="https://raw.github.com/l0stman/muttrc/master/mutt-colors-solarized-dark-256.muttrc" target="_top">this</a>
theme that works pretty well for the moment so I’ll go with that for now.</p><p>Now back to the matter at hand, how to get the sort order setup so that
my newest emails are displayed first.</p><p>So I had to go into my muttrc file and make this changes</p><pre class="literallayout">set sort_aux = 'reverse-date'</pre><p>And make sure I also had the following in my config too:</p><pre class="literallayout">set sort = 'threads'</pre><p>Mutt is now setup, well enough to start playing around, I’ll work on
integrating this into my workflow as time goes on.</p><p>The final things is to move this into it’s own repository for now, as I
will be restarting my dotfiles from scratch once I have all these pieces
setup.</p><p>I did what I usually do, created a git repo and moved my <code class="literal">.muttrc</code> file
to <code class="literal">~/.mutt/muttrc</code> and then renamed the directory to dotmutt.</p><p>Once this was done I went through the motion of pushing the setting to a
new repository.</p><p>I then used braid</p><pre class="literallayout">braid add git://github.com/baphled/muttfiles.git dotmutt
ln -s dotmutt .mutt
ln -s .mutt/muttrc .muttrc</pre><p>Then everything was setup as it where :)</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_todo_3"/>TODO</h4></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
