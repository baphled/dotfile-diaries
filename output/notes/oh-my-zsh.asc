=== Customising oh-my-zsh

Firstly I love VIM, so I want my key bindings whilst using zsh, this
appears to be as easy as adding `set -o vi` in your `~/.zshrc` file.

I'm sure there are more things that you can do to get all of vi niceness
but doing this alone gives up the basics, which we can build upon as we
tweak our setup.

==== TODO

  * look into pulling in my vi key bindings into zsh for general use
  * Make searching my history nicer

==== Tips

  * Renaming multiple files
    ** Add the following to your .zshrc file:

      autoload -U zmv
      alias mmv='noglob zmv -W'

==== To Document

  * Tell me whether I'm in INSERT mode or not via my status bar
