=== Enhancing my workflow

This will be a delve into moving my internet use workflows back into the
console. I find it cumbersome to keep tabbing back and forth and trying to keep
a mental note of how many times I need to tab to get where I want. In the
terminal this can be manage alot easier and at least allow me to set things up
more like how I prefer things to be.

==== Refine my workflow

I already have my dotfiles under version control but I would like to clean
these up and find a way to make them a little bit more maintainable. Primarily
I want to move away from using braid and my forked version of my dotfiles.

This will lead me towards improving my vim settings and skills.

For this I will setup my dotfiles from scratch and show the pros and cons of my
setup and how I like to have things laid out.
