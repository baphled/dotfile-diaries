=== Development changes

Would be nice if we could be automagically told when we need to run
bundle or something critical to the system has changed. Could use hash
tags for this.

Should not be able to push unless the tests are passing
  * This could be a dick, would be an idea to allow for this to be relaxed or easily passed

Convert TODO/FIXME into a backlog
  * Collects all notes
  * lists them in a backlog file
  * Tmux alert when new commits have been made
