==== TODO

  * Setup copy and paste bindings to emulate vim
  * notify me of various changes to applications
    ** email and messages to me come to mind as good starts
  * Would like to improve the mappings for jumping between sessions and window
    ** This is becoming a bit of a pain
  * New panels/windows should automatically cd into the project directory
  * create a binding to allow me to open up links easily.
