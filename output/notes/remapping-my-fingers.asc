=== Remapping my fingers

One of the most interesting things I have picked up whilst getting back to a
console centric workflow is that a lot depends on where my fingers sit on the
keyboard. Over time I learnt to touch type in my own way and after a time I
still find myself looking at the keyboard to find a random key or having to
stretch my fingers more than a typical toucher typer would.

I see the value in typing in traditional way but I never got round to leanring
properly as I've had "othering" to do.

[NOTE]: Need a way of actually relearning where my fingers should be.

I maywell try to attempt this gradually and intergrate it into my daily
entries. It's going to take some dicipline but I think it shouldn't take much
effort to remap my fingers to centre around the homekeys more naturally.
