=== Dotfiles

Various notes on things to improve the way I handle my dotfiles.

  * Should move irssi settings and config into a separate repository
  * Dev Diary should be it's own projects/repository
  * Improve the way I'm handling my credentials
    ** Need to be able to run a script which sets my config
  * Add link to old braid setup GH #313889b
  * Improve the way I ignore files
    ** Use `.git/info/exclude` to hide local files
