I can start a new.</p><p>WARNING:
This can be somewhat hazardious if you rely on having all of your
downloads in your home directory as the following command will remove
everything from your repository and working directory</p><p>This will be used to stripped down my dotvim repository and help me
start from scratch whilst keeping my master branch intacted.</p><pre class="literallayout">git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/stripped
rm .git/index
git clean -fdx</pre><p>This took some time and basically removed everything in my home
directory, which I didn’t really think about prior to running the
command. So going back was not really an option.</p><p>Once the command had finished all my personal setting were removed and I
recieved a bunch of errors relating to RVM not being found. This was
because my zsh settings rely on RVM for prompt information.</p><p>So the first thing I want to do is change into bash and get RVM back up
and running.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_installing_rvm"/>Installing RVM</h3></div></div></div><p>So the first thing i’ll need is RVM. This will be needed by my zsh
prompt and for the dependancies for my workflow.</p><p>I like to have the latest version of Ruby so I can keep up with what’s
new in the latest releases.</p><pre class="literallayout">curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby</pre><p>This will install the latest version of RVM and Ruby, so I am well on my
way to getting Ruby setup on my system.</p><p>Once rvm and the latest version of Ruby installed I wanted to change my
setup so that the gems installed as part of my dotfiles are now
installed in global, so that they are available everywhere.</p><p>To do this I needed to make sure I was in the global gemset which was
done by using the following command.</p><pre class="literallayout">rvm gemset use global</pre><p>Now that I am using the correct gemset, I need to make sure that I run
bundle to make sure that everything is in place.</p><pre class="literallayout">bundle</pre><p>Once this is complete I have all my gems and rvm setup and ready to go.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_resources_7"/>Resources</h4></div></div></div><p><a class="ulink" href="https://rvm.io/rvm/install" target="_top">RVM</a></p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_removing_braid"/>Removing Braid</h3></div></div></div><p>Braid can be a pain and I’d rather have more control over my external
repositories to achieve this I will look into using git submodules. But
first I will need to remove the external repositories and get rid of
braid.</p><p>I had the following gems installed before I started this process:</p><pre class="literallayout">braid
git-scribe
tmuxinator
pry</pre><p>I no longer want to use braid, so I will firstly remove all the external
repositories</p><p>I also have the following external repositories:</p><pre class="literallayout">oh-my-zsh
dotirssi
muttfiles
dotvim</pre><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>Removing these files cause a lot of things to break.</p></div><p>To make sure that I don’t break anything I can’t fix imediately, and to
keep my previous setup, I’ll need to create a new branch</p><pre class="literallayout">gco -b remove_braid</pre><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The above command uses an aliases via oh-my-zsh</p></div><p>We’ll start off by removing these via braid as follows:</p><pre class="literallayout">braid remove oh-my-zsh
braid remove dotirssi
braid remove dotmutt
braid remove dotvim</pre><p>So the most important repository for me is oh-my-zsh it’s pretty much
invaluable and it would be an idea to get this setup as soon as possible.</p><pre class="literallayout">git submodule add git@github.com:baphled/oh-my-zsh.git oh-my-zsh
git submodule init
git submodule update</pre><p>Now I have my zsh setup as a submodule I can make changes to the repository and
push them directory to the right repository :)</p><p>The next thing is to do the same for my other repositories</p><pre class="literallayout">git submodule add git@github.com:baphled/dotvim.git dotvim
git submodule add git@github.com:baphled/muttfiles.git dotmutt
git submodule add git@github.com:baphled/dotirssi.git dotirssi</pre><p>Now any changes made to my external repositories intermally or externally can
now be easily tracked :)</p><p>The last step in the journey is to remove braid from my Gemfile as it is no
longer needed directly by the repository. That is as easy as removing the line
<code class="literal">gem "braid"</code> and running <code class="literal">bundle</code> again.</p><p>Now we have a cleaner repository and less worry in regards to how my other
repositories are updated and managed.</p><p>So now that I am using git’s submodules to manage my external repositories I
can now make local changes and update the correct repository without polutting
my dotfiles with changes that are not directly related to them.</p><p/></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s13.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s15.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Day 8 </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Day 10</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
