did to alleviate these hassles. As I use Vim quite a bit this will be my first port of call. I will then move over to
tmux and zsh.</p><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b/></p><pre class="literallayout">duration: 4 weeks

  * this could be done after the intial 6 weeks</pre></div><p/><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_day_16"/>Day 16</h3></div></div></div><p>The first thing I’m going to need to do is delete my old repository and create a new one with the same name. This will
bork my <code class="literal">dotfile</code> repository submodule but I can easily fix that by either updating the reference manually or removing
and reinstall the plugin via the command line.</p><p>Before I do this I want to move some of my settings around so that they can be easily added or left out if I desire. My
aim here is to make it easier to choose the vim setup I prefer.</p><p>My initial setup will be a bare bones version of Vim with little to none plugins added. As I gain more proficiency I
will gradually add plugins to my workflow to help enhance the keystokes I have already learnt. The first of these will
focus on text objects and then I will focus on movements and making project wide changes.</p><p>I will stick with plugins that enhance the mime types available to me and help with some basic formatting. Once I have
this under my belt I will start to delve into VIML and creating my own plugins and tweaks.</p><p>Whilst doing all this I will be picking up a Practical Vim tip a day to help me productivity. These will generally be
separate entries and will go over what I’ve learnt and how the new skill could be used to improve how I work.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_cleaning_up_my_vim_settings"/>Cleaning up my vim settings</h4></div></div></div><p>So I’ve customised my vim settings quite a bit based on
<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/astrails/dotvim" target="_top">astrails dotvim</a> repository. My changes have
diverged quite abit and I’d rather break them from the branch and start a
fresh. This will lead the way for me stripping down my settings and finding
ways to easily get used to using vim without all the bells and whistles.</p><p>The first thing I need to do is detach from the origination repository and make
sure that my changes are kept in place. Once this is done I can then create a
config setting to not use and plugins and use a base set of configuration
settings so that I can start to improve my basic Vim skills.</p><p>I had to go to github and delete the repository. Once deleted I created a new
repository with the same name and push the repository</p><pre class="literallayout">git push</pre><p>I now have a repository that is not forked to astrails. I still need to let my
dotfiles know that the repository is update and has changed so I need to do the
following</p><pre class="literallayout">gup</pre><p>This detached the head of the repository, which is easy enough to fix, as long
as there are no local changes.</p><pre class="literallayout">g co master</pre><p>Now that the repository is up to date all I need to do is update my <code class="literal">dotfiles</code>
to reflect the changes to the detached repository.</p><pre class="literallayout">cd ~
ga dotvim
g ci -m 'Update my dotvim files'</pre><p>Now the repository is up to date and my dotfiles know of the change I’ve just
made.</p><p>Finally I push the change to my dotfiles and everything is all set.</p><p/></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_day_17"/>Day 17</h3></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_tweaking_my_test_function"/>Tweaking my test function</h4></div></div></div><p>So I have a few custom bindings to run work out what kind of test I am
running and run it with the right tool.</p><p>This has proved quite useful in the past allowing me to run <code class="literal">&lt;leader&gt;t</code>
to run the current or last run test file. The other binding is set to
<code class="literal">&lt;leader&gt;T</code> which runs the closest test to the current line number.</p><p>These have served me well up to today when I had some performance
testing to do and testunit was the only tool setup for the project I was
working on.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Find link to Gary’s dotfiles.</p></div><p>My bindings were originally stolen from "Gary Bernhardt’s dotfiles" and
was tweaked by myself to include cucumber. Now it’s time to fix the
issue with testunit.</p><p>To run my unit tests I will need the following command:</p><pre class="literallayout">exec ":!bundle exec ruby -I\"lib:test\" " . a:filename "</pre><p>This runs my unit test in the correct environemnt. There is one issue
with this. The firstly the other tool we can simple run the test we are
interested with by appending <span class="emphasis"><em>:1</em></span> where <span class="emphasis"><em>1</em></span> is the line number. The
issue with doing this with my unittests is that it is not the expected
command and will error out.</p><pre class="literallayout">:!bundle exec ruby -I"lib:test" test/performance/browsing_test.rb:9

this to work properly as it is a large part of my typical development
workflow.</p><p>To do this I will need to be able to capture the method name relating to
the unit test file. To do this I will need to capture the number and get
the contents of the first and last 5 lines on either side of the line
number received. What ever the closest method name is we’ll use to run a
single unit test.</p><p>I’ll focus on this another day once I have improve my VIML.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="_todo_10"/>TODO</h5></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>

know that AsciiDoc and Markdown snippets.</p><p>At the moment my forked version doesn’t have any snippets for AsciiDoc so I
will have to search for some and merge them into my version and updated my

reviewing my vim packages, I thought I’d start with gist-vim. I tend to need to
post gists quickly and I usually end up using vim to write these notes and
snippets.</p><p>The only problem with this is that I have to go find the file and then copy and
paste the contents via the website. That’s kinda slow and annoying. I’ve used
gist-vim in the past so it’s time to get that setup and running so that I can
send my gists easier.</p><p>Same as usual I start by install the plugin:</p><pre class="literallayout">git submodule add git://github.com/mattn/gist-vim.git bundle/gist-vim</pre><p>I also need <code class="literal">webapi-vim</code> which deal with the API calls to github. As I don’t
need to install it, as it’s already installed I’ll gloss over how it was
installed as it is just a case of adding the plugin and forgetting about it.</p><p>My <code class="literal">plugin.vim</code> doesn’t have any settings for <code class="literal">gist-vim</code> so I’ll add them now
and then go over the basic commands I’ll need to play around with gist via vim.</p><p>I want to be able to copy snippets from a gist:
  let g:gist_clip_command = <span class="emphasis"><em>pbcopy</em></span></p><p>I also want to try to detect the file type gists should be when uploading them:
  let g:gist_detect_filetype = 1</p><p>The default command is <code class="literal">:Gist</code> and <code class="literal">:'&lt;,'&gt;Gist</code> with the following flags for
the various options:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<code class="literal">-p</code> - a private gist
</li><li>
<code class="literal">-P</code> - a public gist
</li><li>
<code class="literal">-m</code> - save a gist with all the buffers

<code class="literal">-d</code> - delete a gist
</li><li>
<code class="literal">-l</code> - list my gists
</li><li>
<code class="literal">-l username</code> - list a users gists
</li></ul></div><p>I could map a few of these commands but I’ll hold off on that for the moment
and just get accustomed to calling it manually.</p><p/></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_reviewing_vim_pastie"/>Reviewing vim-pastie</h4></div></div></div><pre class="literallayout">Name:   gist-vim

Repo:   git://github.com/mattn/gist-vim.git</pre><p>I’ve had this installed pretty much from day one and never really used it. I
guess I typically store my notes in gists or evernotes. The latter I have not
got a plugin for, this will go on the <span class="emphasis"><em>to get</em></span> list.</p><p>Pastie basically does the same as gist-vim put post the content of a buffer(s)

my dotvim.</p><pre class="literallayout">vi .gitmodules

autotag
</li><li>
syntastic
</li><li>
nerdcommenter
</li><li>
asciidoc-vim

<a class="ulink" href="day_18.html#_adding_ctags" target="_top">ctags</a> though I haven’t really spoken about
what it actually does and what it’s benefits are.</p><p>Firstly, the first issue with updating ctags is that when running <code class="literal">ctags -a</code>
you’d only update the current tags list whilst not removing tags that are no
longer needed.</p><p>Autotag updates the ctags for a project everytime a file is saved. This is
needed so that my ctags don’t become stale and include definitions that are no
longer present in the project I am currently working on. Meaning that when
pressing <code class="literal">&lt;C-]&gt;</code> I only get results that are relevent to the project and don’t
have to sift through a load of useless results.</p><p>Autotag requires <span class="emphasis"><em>Python</em></span> support so it is important to have support for this
in my <span class="emphasis"><em>Vim</em></span>. Thankfully if my Vim doesn’t support <span class="emphasis"><em>Python</em></span> then it doesn’t not
fail horribly. These saves me from having to clear my tags manually and just
focus on the task at hand, writing code.</p><p/></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_syntastic"/>Syntastic</h4></div></div></div><p>I use this to help me find syntax errors easily, it doesn’t do this on the fly
but I save often enough for that not to be a problem. All that is needed is for
a file to be saved and if any errors are found the quickbox buffer will open up
allowing for me to go over each change and deal with them appropriately.
Syntastic comes with a host of syntax checker and the basic to allow for me to
easily add more checkers dependent on the filetype I am dealing with.</p><p>It uses the built in Vim commands for navigation or errors <code class="literal">:lnext</code> and
<code class="literal">:lprev</code>. As I’m using unimpaired I have alternative mappings for these as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<code class="literal">[l</code> - <code class="literal">:lnext</code>
</li><li>
<code class="literal">l]</code> - <code class="literal">:lprevious</code>
</li></ul></div><p>Other mime type related plugins also add their own checkers so I have pretty
much all the checkers I need for the moment. The following languages are
included out of the box. The following is just a few that are maintained that I am interest in:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
yaml
</li><li>
jslint
</li><li>
jshint (gillesruppert)
</li><li>
sass

<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic/tree/master/syntax_checkers" target="_top">here</a>.</p><p>I tend not to use a host of these but at least I know they are there if they
are ever needed.</p><p/></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_nerdcommenter"/>NerdCommenter</h4></div></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b/></p><pre class="literallayout">plugin: nerdcommenter

<code class="literal">&lt;leader&gt;/</code> - comments out a line

line but yanks its content first so that you can past is elsewhere. This
is typically useful if you need to modify a line but also want to keep
the orginal commented out but want to past the line or a modified
version of it somewhere else. As with <code class="literal">&lt;leader&gt;c</code> <code class="literal">&lt;leader&gt;cy</code> can be
prefixed with a number allowing you to yank and then copy as many
consecutive lines as you please.</p><p>There is also <code class="literal">&lt;leader&gt;cA</code> which also comments out a line but also
enters you into Insert mode at the end of a line ready to make a change.
This is also accompanied by <code class="literal">&lt;leader&gt;c$</code> which does the same but puts
you at the start of the line.</p><p/></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_asciidoc_vim"/>asciidoc-vim</h4></div></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b/></p><pre class="literallayout">plugin: asciidoc-vim

use tabs for autocompletion but I my vim muscle memory is used to using <code class="literal">&lt;C-n&gt;</code> and <code class="literal">&lt;C-p&gt;</code> to loop through possible

This though may well use more memory that the previous solutions I’ve used but I won’t really know how much so until I
actually start using it. Though this seems like a relatively sane idea for improving the speed in which omnicomplete
finds long strings.</p><p>There is one thing that I need to look out for and that is that noecomplcache caches content so the long strings I’m
currently having issues with maywell cause my machines to slow down as noecomplcache attempts to retrieve data from the

These help me to find and manage
files quickly and help me to manage the buffers I have open.</p><p/><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_bufexplorer"/>bufexplorer</h4></div></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b/></p><pre class="literallayout">plugin: bufexplorer
home:   http://github.com/c9s/bufexplorer
source: git://github.com/c9s/bufexplorer.git</pre></div><p>So dealing with buffers can be somewhat frustrating at times, especially if you
keep a session running for a number of days, as I do, the one thing missing
from Vim is a way to easily navigation open buffers and manage them as needed.</p><p>I came across bufexplorer a few weeks ago whilst watching another developer
coding and flipping buffers. After looking at their vim files I noticed that
they had been using bufexplorer to do this and quickly added it to my
toolchain. It’s easy to configure and adds the nice feature of being able to
list buffers and select and delete them quite easily.</p><p>The first things I did was to remap its default (<code class="literal">&lt;leader&gt;be</code>) to <code class="literal">&lt;leader&gt;,.</code>
mainly as the former feels more natural. There are a few more mappings that it
uses that I haven’t gotten around to making use of yet and it will be these
that I’ll be playing around with from now on. They are as follows:</p><pre class="literallayout">&lt;leader&gt;bs
&lt;leader&gt;bv</pre><p>As you may or may not of figured out this opens bufexplorer in a horizontal and
vertical split respectively.</p><p>The most common command I use at present is deleting buffers (<code class="literal">d</code>) and jumping
to a given buffer. The former still feels a little clumsy, probably as I’m not
making the use of the out of the box commands and defaulting to using search to
find a buffer and press <code class="literal">&lt;Enter&gt;</code> when I’ve found the buffer I am interested in.</p><p>Below is a snippet of the docs which lists some of the internal commands
bufexplorer supports:</p><pre class="literallayout">R             Toggles relative path/absolute path.
D            |:wipeout|the buffer under the cursor from the list.  When a
              buffers is wiped, it will not be shown when unlisted buffer are
              displayed.
f             Toggles whether you are taken to the active window when
              selecting a buffer or not.
o             Opens the buffer that is under the cursor into the current
              window.
p             Toggles the showing of a split filename/pathname.
q             Quit exploring.
r             Reverses the order the buffers are listed in.
s             Selects the order the buffers are listed in. Either by buffer
              number, file name, file extension, most recently used (MRU), or
              full path.
u             Toggles the showing of "unlisted" buffers.</pre><p>I don’t use tabs, in fact I’d rather stay away from them as much as possible so
that commands relating to those have been omitted.</p><p>I’m going to have a play around with the other settings to see how useful they
are and go from there.</p><p>The biggest plus for me is the ability to easily delete buffers without having
to remember the buffers number. This alone is a good enough reason to keep it
in my toolchain.</p><p/></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_nerdtree"/>Nerdtree</h4></div></div></div><p>I’ve touched on Nerdtree in a previous entry, mainly to setup the basics to get me going but I’ll go over some of the
fundermentals of Nerdtree and why I have decided to go back to using it.</p><p>Though <span class="emphasis"><em>netrw</em></span> is quite useful I still needed ways of managing files (create, delete, name). This wasn’t possible with
<span class="emphasis"><em>netrw</em></span> and though I could map <code class="literal">!rm %</code> and the other Unix commands, this grows old quick and needs at least 3 mappings
per command. Nerdtree allowed me to do this quite nicely and although I still have <code class="literal">Ctrl-P</code> to find files I is still
useful to have a file draw to visually display your projects file structure.</p><p>One of the first things I am currently missing is an easy way to open Nerdtree with the current file selected. This
comes in handy when I need to rename or remove a file.</p><p>So to get Nerdtree to open with the current file selected isn’t hard at all I need to do is bind <code class="literal">:NerdtreeFind</code> to a
key and I have what I want:</p><pre class="literallayout">norenmap &lt;leader&gt;p :NERDTreeFind&lt;CR&gt;</pre><p>I already have a binding on <code class="literal">&lt;leader&gt;p</code> so I needed to remove that so that they both don’t collide.</p><pre class="literallayout">":map &lt;leader&gt;p :PromoteToLet&lt;cr&gt;</pre><p>I mentioned in <a class="ulink" href=":day-19-tweaking-nerdtree.asc" target="_top">Tweaking Nerdtree</a> <code class="literal">&lt;C-p&gt;</code> is used to toggle Nerdtrees view. Nerdtree
has a host of commands that you can play with, they are easily viewed by pressing <code class="literal">?</code> within the Nerdtree buffer. I’ll
simply go over the ones I use the most below:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<code class="literal">p</code> - jump to the parent directory
</li><li>
<code class="literal">P</code> - go to the root directory
</li><li>
<code class="literal">o</code> - open and close a directory
</li><li>
<code class="literal">x</code> - close and close a directory
</li><li>
<code class="literal">X</code> - recursively close and close a directory
</li><li>
<code class="literal">C</code> - Make the current directory to the tree root
</li><li>
<code class="literal">I</code> - Display hidden files
</li></ul></div><p>These commands I tend to use the most especially when I need to create and/or manage files:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<code class="literal">m</code> - show menu
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li>
<code class="literal">m</code> - rename node
</li><li>
<code class="literal">c</code> - copy node
</li><li>
<code class="literal">a</code> - add node
</li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>A node is basically a file or directory, to specify a directory you simply need to add a forward slash (<span class="emphasis"><em>/</em></span>).</p><p>Nerdtree support a few other features that I don’t really use at present, bookmarking directories could be quite useful
but opening files in different tabs isn’t something I’m fond off.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>I’m aware that there are commands to CRUD files using <span class="emphasis"><em>netrw</em></span> but I still am not a fan of the way <code class="literal">:Explore</code> opens and

out. I used to use <span class="emphasis"><em>Control-T</em></span> in the past but that had the extra dependency of needing vim compiled with Ruby support,
though this is not particularly a big deal, <span class="emphasis"><em>Control-T</em></span> is somewhat slow at time and remembering to compile its binaries
can be a pain. This is where <span class="emphasis"><em>CtrlP</em></span> takes the lead.</p><p>I’ve never really spent much time seeing what other features <span class="emphasis"><em>CtrlP</em></span> has that I am not aware of. The main thing I never
really took advantage of or bothered really to look more into is the ability to search by buffer or MRU (most recently
used) files. I could also bind <code class="literal">::CtrlPBuffer</code> and <code class="literal">:CtrlPMRU</code> for when I want to be more specific. For the moment I
will hold out on this and make use of <code class="literal">&lt;C-f&gt;</code> and <code class="literal">&lt;C-b&gt;</code> to navigate back and forth between search modes.</p><p>There is a regexp feature that I have never used (<code class="literal">&lt;C-r&gt;</code>) I should experiement with this a little to find out what it
is actually capable of for the moment it is enough to make use of searching dependent of search type.</p><p>There is also a nice navigation command to allow me to move up a directory <code class="literal">..&lt;CR&gt;</code>.</p><p>I like to have <span class="emphasis"><em>CtrlP</em></span> search for files in my current project, in which case the setting below does just that. Well that
a bit of a lie, it starts searchs from the directory that contains SCM content. In my case as all my project use git or
another SCM so I know what the root directory is.</p><pre class="literallayout">let g:ctrlp_working_path_mode = r                               "Set to a directory that contains .git</pre><p>I also have <span class="emphasis"><em>CtrlP</em></span> default overiden so that I can use <code class="literal">&lt;C-P&gt;</code> for something else.

sticking to what I already know. This plugin is quite extensive so I’ll spend more time on getting to grips with the
mappings that I have not used often.</p><p>There are a couple of cool things I can do with these mappings one of the main ones is being able to add tags to
multiple lines at once. One prime example of where this comes in handy is when we want to create a list of HTML
elements. First we’d get a list of something.</p><pre class="literallayout">&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Beans&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chocolate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre><p>Then we’d type the following:</p><pre class="literallayout">ggVG
'&lt;,'&gt;normal yss&lt;li&gt;
ggVGS&lt;ul&gt;</pre><p>Which gives us the output below:</p><pre class="literallayout">&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Beans&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chocolate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre><p>So what if I want to have the original list back, the standard way of doing this would be to type u a few times. That’s
boring, surround can help us here to with a couple of commands:</p><pre class="literallayout">ggVG
'&lt;,'&gt;normal dst</pre><p>We end up with the content pretty much back to normal:</p><pre class="literallayout">Rice

homwpage: http://github.com/tpope/vim-abolish
source:   git://github.com/tpope/vim-abolish</pre></div><p>Abolish is an interesting plugin created by Time Pope, it is essentially 3 plugins wrapped up into 1 (abbreviation,
substitution, coercion).</p><p>We all have problems with our fingers not listening to our brains.  Abbreviation helps us map our common typing mistakes
with what we actually wanted to type. For example I recently had problems type <span class="emphasis"><em>editions</em></span> and ended up typing <span class="emphasis"><em>edtions</em></span>
instead.</p><p>Stolen from the plugins homepage, the syntax to invoke abbreviation is as follows:</p><pre class="literallayout">Abolish {despa,sepe}rat{e,es,ed,ing,ely,ion,ions,or}       {despe,sepa}rat{}</pre><p>The documentation suggests that I add my abbreviations to <span class="emphasis"><em>~/.vim/after/plugin/abolish.vim</em></span></p><p>Appending a <span class="emphasis"><em>!</em></span> to the command and the abbreviation will be added to <span class="emphasis"><em>~/.vim/after/plugin/abolish.vim</em></span>.</p><pre class="literallayout">Abolish! edtion{,s} edition</pre><p>Abbreviations can also be removed by adding the <span class="emphasis"><em>--delete</em></span> flag as follows:</p><pre class="literallayout">Abolish -delete edtion{,s}</pre><p>We can also search for variants as well as accomplishing complete, this is means we can find a string regardless of its
case and variant which can be quite helpful.</p><pre class="literallayout">:Abolish -search edit{s,ion}
:S edit{s,ion}</pre><p>Which searches for:
  edit
  edition
  editions</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>This didn’t work for me at the time of writing this. Should find out why.</p></div><p>The next part of the plugin is substitution. There are occasions when we need to search and replace a variant of a word
whilst still keeping its case and variation. This could be done via a bundle of substitution commands but this can be
error prone and lead to missed changes which can be tedious.</p><pre class="literallayout">:%S/edit{ion,s}/edit/g</pre><p>Which will change both <span class="emphasis"><em>edits</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>edition</em></span> to <span class="emphasis"><em>edit</em></span>.</p><p>Finally there is the CoeRse command. The command is very useful when it comes to coding and when you want to change a
variable names format from one to another. For example when you have the variable <span class="emphasis"><em>FilePath</em></span> which you want to change to
<span class="emphasis"><em>file_path</em></span>. You simply type <code class="literal">crs</code> and the variable is now converted to snakecase.</p><p>To coerce a variable into another format you simply start off with the <span class="emphasis"><em>cr</em></span> and append one of the below keys to change
the variables case.</p><pre class="literallayout">c: camelCase
m: MixedCase
_: snake_case
s: snake_case

allows you to create and use custom keys accompanied by <code class="literal">&lt;TAB&gt;</code> to quickly type a string. In the past snipmate came with
a host of snippets as part of the plugin but as time has gone on it has dropped them as the list of snippets is quite
exhaustive. They now belong as part of <span class="emphasis"><em>snipmate-snippets</em></span>.</p><p>I’m also not a fan of having bloated customisations and have decided to fork <span class="emphasis"><em>snipmate-snippets</em></span> so that I can tweak it

time aside for stripping down customising my snippets.</p><p/></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_day_30"/>Day 30</h3></div></div></div><p>Today I’ll be having a look at some text object orientated plugins.

to wrap my muscle memory around for a long while.</p><p>So the ideal of text objects is that you are able to select a grouping of text easily whilst doing something with it.
The atypical thing to do is the following:</p><p>The first puts me in visual mode and highlights everything inside the block
  vir</p><p>This does similar to the above but highlights all of the block
  var</p><p>It doesn’t stop there anything that you can do with a single character, you can do with this and other text objects.

</li><li>
vim-coffeescript

homepage:   http://github.com/claco/jasmine.vim
source:     git://gitHub.com/claco/jasmine.vim.git</pre><p>I like to test what I’m coding and javascript is no exception, the best unit test tool I’ve used so far is <span class="emphasis"><em>Jasmine</em></span>. I
prefer this as it is not that far removed from <span class="emphasis"><em>rspec</em></span> and it allows me to cleanly write tests whilst driving out
implementation code. I’ve been using jasmine.vim to help tweak vim to support the framework and provide me with some
useful snippets so that I don’t have to type too much. It also has the added feature of allowing you to run specs from
within vim, which I am used to doiing for my specs and scenarios. Another benefit of this plugin is it provides
boilerplates for generating new jasmine files, which again saves me from having to repeat myself constantly.</p><p>There are a couple of things I’d like to do to keep things centralised. Firstly move the snippets into my custom
snippets repository. Keeping all my snippets in one place is going to save me hunting them down later which I’d rather
not do. I’d also like to move the templates into a centralised place so that I can build up some boilerplates for other
bits that I work on (rspec, controllers, models, etc).</p><p>The plugin also support syntax highlighting which is always quite useful. For the time being I’ll gloss over the
snippets bundled in this plugin and go over them once I have them centralised.</p><p/></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_vim_coffee_script"/>vim-coffee-script</h4></div></div></div><p>This is another plugin centered around my frontend activities and bring coffeescript support into my <span class="emphasis"><em>vim</em></span>. The added
bonus of this plugin is that not only does it have syntax highlighting but it also allows you to compile coffeescript
into Javascript straight from <span class="emphasis"><em>vim</em></span>.</p><p>To compile coffeescript you run the following command:
  :CoffeeMake</p><p>Output can also be hidden using the following alternative:
  :silent CoffeeMake</p><p>I can also set coffeescript files to compile automatically with the following setting in my vimrc:
  au BufWritePost *.coffee silent CoffeeMake!</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>When compiling coffeescript I’ll need to set the path to coffee so that the plugin knows where to find it.</p></div><p>I’ll refrain from doing this at the moment as I tend to use coffeescript with Rails, which deals with compiling
coffeescript within the asset pipeline, but it is a useful thing to note down and I’m sure once I get to the point of
defining different vim workflows I’ll be able to conditionally set this for pure JS projects that I work on in the
future.</p><p>The is also the ability to compile sections of coffeescript which seems interesting. Similarly to specifying a range in
other command you simply prefix the range you want to specify with the compile command:</p><pre class="literallayout">3,5 CoffeeCompile</pre><p>There is also the ability to run coffeelint on a file to sanity check it, which is also very nice. The one thing I hate
is watching everything compile and pass yet to find that lint doesn’t like what I’ve done.</p><pre class="literallayout">:CoffeeLint</pre><p>I’ll need to add coffeelint to my toolchain and tell the plugin where to find it by supplying the following command in
my vimrc:</p><pre class="literallayout">let coffee_linter = '/usr/bin/coffeelint'</pre><p>Finally I can run coffeescript directly within vim with the following:</p><pre class="literallayout">:CoffeeRun</pre><p>This will open up another buffer with the scripts output in it.</p><p/></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_vim_json"/>vim-json</h4></div></div></div><p>This plugin is basically adds syntax highlighting and file type detection so that the JSON format is recognisable by
vim. There really isn’t thing else to it.</p><p>As I use JSON quite a bit for my day to day work, this functionality is indespensible and saves me trying to add it to
my vimrc file which is the last thing I want to do.</p><p/></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_day_32"/>Day 32</h3></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>

added. As soon as a feature file is saved compilation is started and shortly after, if there are any errors, you will be
alerted via the quick tip buffer.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="_mappings"/>Mappings</h5></div></div></div><p>There are a few mappings that <code class="literal">vim-cucumber</code> includes, though they are not actually documented anywhere.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
