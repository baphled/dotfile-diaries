<simpara>The goal of this diary is to track the journey of improving my unix-fu and work flow.</simpara>
<simpara>This will be an on going process and will help me keep track of the things I have learnt and as well as how I have
improved my console fu over the course of time.</simpara>
<simpara>There is no end to this diary, there is no real end to this diary so the size of it may well become quite substantial.
I&#8217;m not sure what I&#8217;ll do in that regard and will shelve that decision for when I have gone over 90 days or so.</simpara>
<simpara>This diary, although written in that way, will not actually be a daily account of what I have done but based on the
collective days I have spent focusing on tweaking my workflow.</simpara>
<simpara>The notes in the appendix will gradually be rewritten as entries or moved into the specific entry when neccessary. So
over time the entries may well be tweak for readability and clarity sake.  I&#8217;ll start off with a very basic workbench
and build it up to the point where it it optimal for my personal use and configurable enough for others to do the same
too.</simpara>
<simpara><?asciidoc-pagebreak?></simpara>
<simpara>I&#8217;ve come to love my current setup (tmux, oh-my-zsh, Vim, RVM and bundle).  Setting up my environment may well get more
complex so I&#8217;ll setup a script that will check whether these tools are available and install them if they are not.</simpara>
<simpara>Vim and oh-my-zsh are easy, I already have separate repositories for these. I&#8217;m going to be opinionated for the moment
an focus on installing the other tools via brew and apt. I&#8217;ll check the OS and use the correct install recipe
accordingly.</simpara>
<simpara>The idea here is to document the changes I make to my dotfiles on a daily basis to help me tweak my productivity whilst
working in the terminal.</simpara>

<section id="_enhancing_my_workflow">
<title>Enhancing my workflow</title>
<simpara>This will be a delve into move the my internet related information back into the console. I find it cumbersome to keep
tabbing back and forth and trying to keep a mental note of how many times I need to tab to get where I want. In the
terminal this can be manage a lot easier and at least allow me to set things up more like how I prefer things to be.</simpara>

<title>Day 1</title>
<simpara>So this is the first day of an on going process devised by myself to help improve and tweak my existing work flow.</simpara>
<simpara>For years I&#8217;ve been used to living in the console and staying away from GUI type tools to do my day to day work</simpara>
<simpara>So the idea is to move back to my console and improve my work flow by tweaking and getting to know my console tools
better.</simpara>
<simpara>In this blog I&#8217;ll start with something simple, as the days progress I create a blog describing what I&#8217;ve learnt today
and how it improves my day to day work flow.</simpara>
<simpara>Today is an easy day, I&#8217;ll start with setting up irssi, a command line interface for IRC.</simpara>
<simpara>What I want here is my old setup tweaked to make it easy to change channels and see is in a room.</simpara>
<section id="_setting_up_irssi">
<title>Setting up irssi</title>
<simpara>I&#8217;m using a Mac and use brew. So it is as easy as running <literal>brew install irssi</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Job done!</simpara>
<section id="_configuring">
<title>Configuring</title>
<simpara>I like to see all the most important information right in front of me, so my
ideal IRC client looks something like this:</simpara>
<simpara><inlinemediaobject>
  <imageobject>
  <imagedata fileref="images/irssi-current.png" contentwidth="500"/>
  </imageobject>
  <textobject><phrase>preferred setup</phrase></textobject>
</inlinemediaobject></simpara>
<simpara>Unconfigured, irssi looks like this:</simpara>
<simpara><inlinemediaobject>
  <imageobject>
  <imagedata fileref="images/irssi-default.png" contentwidth="500"/>
  </imageobject>
  <textobject><phrase>default setup</phrase></textobject>
</inlinemediaobject></simpara>
<simpara>Which kinda sucks!, where&#8217;s a list of who is online?</simpara>
<simpara>First things first, <ulink url="http://quadpoint.org/articles/irssi/">is a good place to start</ulink>.</simpara>
<simpara>I&#8217;ll use some tips from there to get myself started.</simpara>
<simpara>twirssi - twitter for irc
nicklist - displays a list of users</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_defaults">
<title>Defaults</title>
<simpara>Now it&#8217;s time to tweak our settings so that we can navigate freely and don&#8217;t
have to decypher what is being said per room. I&#8217;m used to having a window per
channel and being alerted when someone makes a comment. For this I&#8217;d like to
create a window every time I join a new channel and remove the window once I
have left one. To do this we&#8217;ll need aliases.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">/SET autocreate_windows ON`
/SERVER ADD -auto -network freenode irc.freenode.net
/save
/exit</literallayout>
<simpara>This will save us from having to add the FQDN and refer to it as an alias,
freenode in this case.</simpara>
<simpara>Now when you restart irssi you will be automatically connected to freenode :)</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_listing_channel_users">
<title>Listing channel users</title>
<simpara>So to get the user list we&#8217;ll need nicklist with some tweaks.</simpara>
<simpara>The older versions of nicklist require us to use screen/tmux and do some
hackery, I&#8217;m not a fan, thankfully I stumbled across this
<ulink url="http://github.com/ConX/nicklist.pl">nicklist.pl</ulink>. This isn&#8217;t ideal, we have
the user list at the top but it&#8217;s much better than hoping that the screens open
and things fire off at the right time.</simpara>
<simpara>That a soon after finding the sweet spot, the original version of the script
decided to kill the cat command you had to run to get the user list, not my
idea of fun.</simpara>
<simpara>This will do for the moment but as part of my weekend of hacking I hope to
tweak this script to get the layout I want.</simpara>
<simpara>We will need to create a scripts directory for scripts we want to autoload.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">/WINDOW NEW
/WINDOW NAME hilight
/WINDOW MOVE up
/WINDOW SIZE 10
/WINDOW stick
/layout save</literallayout>
<simpara>This will create a new window called <emphasis>hilight</emphasis> which will be displayed at the
top be sticking 10 lines high, which means that it will stay in position
regardless of changing channel windows.</simpara>
<simpara>Finally we make sure that our nick is highlighted with <literal>/hilight nick</literal></simpara>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll leave this for now and come back to tweaking our settings later.</simpara>

<title>Day 2</title>
<simpara>So I&#8217;ve in the previous posts I&#8217;ve setup irssi and setup twirssi so that I can keep up to date with my tweets without
having to deal with a GUI.</simpara>
<simpara>Now I want to tweak my settings so that I can open links easily and have a few more channels setup in hidden windows.</simpara>
<simpara>I&#8217;d also like to setup vim-mode for irssi</simpara>
<simpara>Today I&#8217;ll be tweaking Irssi so that I can interact with my Instant Messager and twitter accounts.</simpara>
<section id="_grabbing_links">
<title>Grabbing links</title>
<simpara>I want to a way to handle links, their everywhere and their useful, to do this
I&#8217;ll use bjurl.pl to highlight links and give me the ability to open and copy
them.</simpara>
<simpara>I used this version of
<ulink url="http://raw.github.com/sukima/bjurl/master/bjurl.pl">bjurl</ulink>. I&#8217;ll copy it to
the usual place (<literal>~/.irssi/scripts/autorun</literal>) we can than run the script and we
have a nicely highlighted URL&#8217;s :D</simpara>
<simpara>To open files we&#8217;ll need to do some more configuration, as I&#8217;m on a mac, I&#8217;ll
download Lynx and get it to open in a new tmux window. We&#8217;ll setup our browser as lynx as it&#8217;s a command line browser.</simpara>
<simpara><?asciidoc-pagebreak?></simpara>
</section>
<section id="_adding_our_im_to_irssi">
<title>Adding our IM to irssi</title>
<simpara>So we&#8217;ve done quite a bit with our irc client in ways of centralising communicaions, wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if we could get our IM&#8217;s to play nicely too? Well it seems that it isn&#8217;t much of a problem.</simpara>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll download bitlbee and create a new window for it in our irssi client.</simpara>
<simpara>First, the download:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">brew install bitlbee</literallayout>
<simpara>Now we can connect to one of the bitlbee servers and get things setup.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">/win new hidden
/win name bitlbee
/server im.uk.bitlbee.org 6667</literallayout>
<simpara>This should automatically join you to the "&amp;bitlbee" channel, this is where
you&#8217;ll be able to setup your account and send messages :)</simpara>
<simpara>Once connected you&#8217;ll need to register and set a password</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">/register &lt;username&gt;
/OPER</literallayout>
<simpara>Once you have entered these commands you will be prompted to enter your password</simpara>
<simpara>All set? good, now we can start adding accounts</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">account add jabber &lt;your gmail email address&gt;
/OPER</literallayout>
<simpara>Now you can enter your IM&#8217;s password. Rince and repeat until you have added all your accounts.</simpara>
<simpara>Finally call <literal>account on</literal> bitlbee will connect you to all of your accounts :)</simpara>
<simpara>All accounts successfully connected to will be stored so the next time you connect to bitlbee all you need to do is run the following commands</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">/identify &lt;username&gt;
/OPER</literallayout>
<simpara>Once you enter your password you can then call <literal>account on</literal> and log into all IM&#8217;s</simpara>
<simpara>Simples :D</simpara>

<title>Day 3</title>
<simpara>So for today, I&#8217;d like to stop using twitter and move it my console. I love Twitter but GUI&#8217;s are exceptionally slow and
I&#8217;d like a lot more control over what I can see when and how it&#8217;s displayed.</simpara>
<section id="_setting_up_twitter_in_my_console">
<title>Setting up twitter in my console</title>
<simpara>For this we&#8217;ll use <ulink url="http://github.com/zigdon/twirssi/issues">twirssi</ulink>,
recommended to me by <ulink url="http://twitter.com/23me">@23me</ulink>, who I used to spend a lot
of time chatting on IRC with in my misspent youth.</simpara>
<section id="_the_setup">
<title>The setup</title>
<simpara>So the first step is to download and setup the script and take it from there.</simpara>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll need to add the Net::Twitter from CPAN:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install Net::Twitter'
sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install JSON::Any'</literallayout>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll also need to run the script and pass our username:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">/win new hidden
/win name twitter
/script load twirssi.pl
/twitter_login username
/twirssi_oauth &lt;username&gt;@Twitter &lt;pin&gt;</literallayout>
<simpara>This will create a new hidden window call it twitter and load the script and
finally set the username. You will then be asked to authorise the application
by visiting the displayed link, once this is done, you should then be ready to
use twitter via irssi :)</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">/layout save
/save</literallayout>
<simpara>Now you settings are saved we can happily close irssi knowing that our setup
will still persist :D</simpara>
<simpara>For further customisation, checkout <ulink url="http://twirssi.com/?using">twirssi&#8217;s user guide</ulink></simpara>
<simpara><?asciidoc-pagebreak?></simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section id="_setting_up_vim_mode">
<title>Setting up vim-mode</title>
<simpara>Now, where would we be if we didn&#8217;t have a favourite text editors key settings
available in irssi.</simpara>
<simpara>That&#8217;d be heaven right, we&#8217;ll it&#8217;s pretty damn easy to get this going and to
add your own mappings, which is wicked, though it&#8217;d be even better if we could
just pull in our mappings from vim itself but that&#8217;s for another day.</simpara>
<simpara>For now we&#8217;ll just setup vim-mode for irssi, which is easy as hell, and get it
setup so that we can take advantage of some of the key bindings I&#8217;ve gotten
used to.</simpara>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll get that from
<ulink url="http://raw.github.com/shabble/irssi-scripts/master/vim-mode/vim_mode.pl">here</ulink>.
We&#8217;ll also grab uberprompt which vim-mode depends on for some extra
<ulink url="http://raw.github.com/shabble/irssi-scripts/master/prompt_info/uberprompt.pl">vim
like</ulink> functionality.</simpara>
<simpara>Once downloaded and added to your autorun directory we&#8217;re pretty much good to
go. Run the following:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">/run vim_mode</literallayout>
<simpara>Then we should be good to go :)</simpara>
<simpara>The source file has heaps of information, much of which I&#8217;ve not had the chance
to read through properly yet, on how to get started and set things up just how
like. So take look at that and determine what is the best for you :)</simpara>
<simpara>For the lazy, like me, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve done so far to get started.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">/statusbar window add vim_mode
/statusbar window add vim_windows</literallayout>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll want to save these changes</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">/layout save
/save</literallayout>
<simpara>This will help you to know when you are in Insert or Command mode.</simpara>
<simpara>There&#8217;s heaps of documentation on vim-mode via the source file, so delve in and
start hacking. Admittedly I&#8217;d love it if it took my vim settings but hell, it&#8217;s
not too much hassle to setup mapping for the most important things :)</simpara>
<simpara>At present these are the mappings that I&#8217;ve setup to get started with</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">map &lt;C-H&gt; &lt;BS&gt;
map &lt;Leader&gt; ,
map &lt;Leader&gt;p :bprev
map &lt;Leader&gt;n :bnext</literallayout>
<simpara>I remapped the leader key to the <literal>'</literal> as this is what I have setup in my vim. I
also setup <literal>:bprev `and `:bnext</literal> so that I can easily move around to the next
and previous windwos within irssi.</simpara>
<simpara>It would be nice to create a binding for specifying a window to navigate to
but I&#8217;ll leave this for another time.</simpara>
<simpara>I could also setup bindings for navigating between split windows by adding the
below mappings to  <literal>vim_moderc</literal></simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">map &lt;C-h&gt; &lt;C-w&gt;h
map &lt;C-j&gt; &lt;C-w&gt;j
map &lt;C-k&gt; &lt;C-w&gt;k
map &lt;C-l&gt; &lt;C-w&gt;l</literallayout>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll also want to add bingins for navigating. Irssi uses &lt;ESC&gt; # to navigate
to a given window, as we have vim-mode setup &lt;ESC&gt; is used to change vim modes
so we&#8217;ll need to remap these so that they would with the new setup.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">MAPPING TO BE ADDED LATER</literallayout>
<simpara>Making <literal>&lt;esc&gt;</literal> has been remapped we should be able to easily move around
windows without having to rely on our newly created <literal>&lt;leader&gt;p</literal> and <literal>&lt;leader&gt;n</literal>
keys.</simpara>
<simpara><?asciidoc-pagebreak?></simpara>

<section id="_day_4">
<title>Day 4</title>
<simpara>So I&#8217;ve done quite a bit to get irssi setup and working as I want it.  The last things I want to do is lose my settings
or messing something up, as I have done a number of times already.</simpara>
<section id="_keeping_my_settings_under_version_control">
<title>Keeping my settings under version control</title>
<simpara>So the easy fix for this is to create a repository and pull the config
in as dotirssi.</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
There`s not much to this really.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
I copy the .irssi directory to dotirssi.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
I then initialised git for version control.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Created a new repository on github
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
ignored files with the pattern <literal>scripts/twirssi.*</literal>
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Commited all the files
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
pushed the changes
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
added the project to my dotfiles using braid
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
This will change some point in this process
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Copy my twirssi auth files to <literal>~/dotirssi/scripts</literal>
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Once the above was done I was able to have my irssi settings up version
control :)</simpara>
<simpara><?asciidoc-pagebreak?></simpara>
</section>
<section id="_opening_links_irssi_with_lynx">
<title>Opening links irssi with lynx</title>
<simpara>Yet another day of tweaking my irssi rig, today I want to get Lynx to open in a
new tmux window when I select a link. I&#8217;ll use tmux to do this as it&#8217;s what
it&#8217;s good at and I&#8217;ll get bjurl to call tmux when ever I select a link for
viewing.</simpara>
<simpara>Again the goal here is to move more of my work flow into my terminal which will
allow me to deal with content when I choose.</simpara>
<simpara>First off we need to actually be able to easily see links and open them,
we&#8217;ll use <ulink url="http://github.com/sukima/bjurl/blob/master/bjurl.pl">bjurl</ulink> for this.</simpara>
<simpara>As with most plugins this is as simple as downloading the script and
adding it to your irssi script directory.</simpara>
<simpara>If your already running irssi run <literal>/run bjurl</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>As I&#8217;m using a mac, I needed to to set the <literal>browse_command</literal> settings to
open links just how I want it to.</simpara>
<simpara>First we need a new tmux window to start lynx in.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">tmux new-window -t workbench -s interwepts</literallayout>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll need tell bjurl to behave as we want:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">/set browse_command tmux send-keys -t interwepts 'lynx $1' C-m</literallayout>
<simpara>And that&#8217;s pretty much it for now, we can now load links within our current session :)</simpara>
<simpara>It would be cool if we had a separate session strictly for browsing, that
way we don&#8217;t have to clutter the current session.</simpara>
<simpara>This and a few other things will be the next step for improving this work flow
but lets take small steps and see where this path leads up :)</simpara>
<section id="_todo">
<title>TODO</title>
<simpara>It would be cool if we could name our window accordingly and not have to deal
with the many windows issue I have with chrome and many other browser at
present. This only leads to a sluggish computer and "Tab overload"</simpara>
<simpara>I also need bjurl to be a bit smarter in identifying links, it&#8217;s hard to track
links once 20 have been displayed, at present it&#8217;s quite useless.</simpara>

<section id="_day_5">
<title>Day 5</title>
<simpara>So we&#8217;ve got Lynx setup to work with irssi, after doing so I found out that w3m can deal with tabs and images.
Admittedly I&#8217;m not particularly a fan of tabs, mainly as I tend to build up quite a collection of these and never really
go back to them, but I&#8217;ll give it a whirl and see what the pros and cons of it as opposed to lynx.</simpara>
<section id="_playing_with_w3m">
<title>Playing with w3m</title>
<simpara>As always I used brew <literal>brew install w3m</literal> to get things rolling.</simpara>
<simpara>So this is what w3m looks like out of the box.</simpara>
<simpara><inlinemediaobject>
  <imageobject>
  <imagedata fileref="images/w3m-default.png" contentwidth="500"/>
  </imageobject>
  <textobject><phrase>default setup</phrase></textobject>
</inlinemediaobject></simpara>
<simpara>Off the bat the colours are all wrong, trying to red blue text is near
impossible when using a black background, so that had to be changed.</simpara>
<simpara>The other issue was that though I still had my vim keys I could not use
<literal>&lt;C-B&gt;</literal> and <literal>&lt;C-F&gt;</literal> to move around, which is annoying, that&#8217;ll have to be
changed too.</simpara>
<note><simpara>how do i change the binding?</simpara></note>
<simpara><ulink url="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/MANUAL">manual</ulink></simpara>
<simpara>I also couldn&#8217;t see URL&#8217;s at all.</simpara>
<simpara>I guess the first step is to work out how to customise w3m so that we
can get those colours sorted and give it some vim love.</simpara>
<simpara>Ok, so changing the settings is quite easy to get to, simply press <literal>o</literal>
whilst having w3m open and the settings page will be displayed. We
simple need to scroll down to <emphasis>Colour Settings</emphasis> and specify the colours we desire.</simpara>
<simpara>Viewing links it&#8217;s just as easy as interacting with any other link so
that&#8217;s cool :)</simpara>
<simpara>The only things that niggles me is not being able to set up leader key</simpara>
<simpara>The most important once for the moment are to page up and down quickly
as the default mappings are quite a stretch.</simpara>
<simpara>Add the below to the keymap file within <literal>~/.w3m</literal> gives me the ability to
do exactly this.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">keymap  F     NEXT_PAGE
keymap  B     PREV_PAGE</literallayout>
<simpara>Now that w3m is setup a for navigating a little easier, I&#8217;ll swap out

<literallayout class="monospaced">/set browse_command tmux send-keys -t interwepts 'w3m $1' C-m</literallayout>

<simpara>Before we commit this to version control, we&#8217;ll make some tweaks to the
config file to make it less specific to a Mac.</simpara>
<simpara>Below is a snippet from my config that I should change, when on a different
box, I probably won&#8217;t have brew installed and I prefer to have all my settings
controlled locally so we wont need the references to the skeleton configs.</simpara>
<programlisting language="sh" linenumbering="unnumbered">    urimethodmap ~/.w3m/urimethodmap, /usr/local/Cellar/w3m/0.5.3/etc/w3m/urimethodmap
    mailcap ~/.w3m/mailcap, /usr/local/Cellar/w3m/0.5.3/etc/w3m/mailcap
    mime_types ~/.mime.types, /usr/local/Cellar/w3m/0.5.3/etc/mime.types</programlisting>
<simpara>It now looks like this:</simpara>
<screen>    urimethodmap ~/.w3m/urimethodmap
    mailcap ~/.w3m/mailcap
    mime_types ~/.mime.types</screen>
<simpara>So now we&#8217;re pretty much ready to play around with it for a while and take
notes of things that I&#8217;d like to change.</simpara>

<title>Taming the mutt</title>
<simpara>I&#8217;d like to use mutt for dealing with my email, AppleMail is cool but
it&#8217;s way too much for my liking and I&#8217;d prefer it if I could organise my
emails without having to fiddle with sub folders manually.</simpara>
<simpara>I my old config this was done by using procmail to create/send emails to
folders dependant on the source of the email.</simpara>
<simpara>This was pretty configurable so I&#8217;d like to get some of this back into
my current setup so that I don&#8217;t get email overload :)</simpara>
<section id="_setting_things_up">
<title>Setting things up</title>
<simpara>I had a better setup a while back but after rummaging around for ancient backups I decided to start from scratch.</simpara>
<simpara>Again, I&#8217;ll be using brew to get mutt installed <literal>brew install mutt</literal></simpara>
<simpara>You&#8217;ll need to run the following commands:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">mkdir -p ~/.mutt/cache/headers
mkdir ~/.mutt/cache/bodies
touch ~/.mutt/certificates</literallayout>
<simpara>Next I needed to create a <literal>.muttrc</literal> file, to setup my GMail account. I
used this example
<ulink url="http://github.com/baphled/dotmutt/raw/master/muttrc">here</ulink> to get things
started.</simpara>
<simpara>I had to make a few tweaks to get things just right. Firstly the order
of the emails were newest at the bottom which is kind of annoying, I&#8217;d
like to see my newest emails first, so this needs to be sorted.</simpara>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll hold out on that for the moment and customise the look of mutts, I
stumbled upon
<ulink url="https://raw.github.com/l0stman/muttrc/master/mutt-colors-solarized-dark-256.muttrc">this</ulink>
theme that works pretty well for the moment so I&#8217;ll go with that for now.</simpara>
<simpara>Now back to the matter at hand, how to get the sort order setup so that
my newest emails are displayed first.</simpara>
<simpara>So I had to go into my muttrc file and make this changes</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">set sort_aux = 'reverse-date'</literallayout>
<simpara>And make sure I also had the following in my config too:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">set sort = 'threads'</literallayout>
<simpara>Mutt is now setup, well enough to start playing around, I&#8217;ll work on
integrating this into my workflow as time goes on.</simpara>
<simpara>The final things is to move this into it&#8217;s own repository for now, as I
will be restarting my dotfiles from scratch once I have all these pieces
setup.</simpara>
<simpara>I did what I usually do, created a git repo and moved my <literal>.muttrc</literal> file
to <literal>~/.mutt/muttrc</literal> and then renamed the directory to dotmutt.</simpara>
<simpara>Once this was done I went through the motion of pushing the setting to a
new repository.</simpara>
<simpara>I then used braid</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">braid add git://github.com/baphled/muttfiles.git dotmutt
ln -s dotmutt .mutt
ln -s .mutt/muttrc .muttrc</literallayout>
<simpara>Then everything was setup as it where :)</simpara>

<title>Day 6</title>
<simpara>I&#8217;ve been writing quite a bit recently and have wanted to play around with git-scribe for authoring my diary and
possibly writing projects in the future.</simpara>
<simpara>Today I&#8217;ll be setting up git-scribe and updating my diary so that I can generate content in various formats. Initially
I&#8217;ll only publish this content as HTML but then move on to PDF and epub later once I&#8217;ve ironed out the kinks.</simpara>
<section id="_setting_up_git_scribe">
<title>Setting up git-scribe</title>
<simpara>It&#8217;s not directly related but I love to write and I&#8217;d like my setup to
allow me to easily write new material and publish them in various formats.</simpara>
<simpara>I&#8217;ve been watching git-scribe for some time and thought this would be a
perfect time to bring it into my current workflow.</simpara>
<simpara>I&#8217;ll setup git-scribe as it allows me to write my entries in AsciiDoc
format and compile it into a number of formats (html, pdf, mobi, etc).</simpara>
<simpara>As this is the case we&#8217;ll have a play with this setup and possibly use
it for publishing other material.</simpara>
<simpara>There&#8217;s not much to this really the project has great
<ulink url="https://github.com/spf13/asciidoc-vim">documentation</ulink></simpara>
<simpara>Once installed I started initialised the new book.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git scribe init</literallayout>
<simpara>Once this was done I had the basic setup needed to move my diary. git-scribe
uses AsciiDoc to format content so I needed to convert the old markdown. That
wasn&#8217;t so much trouble as there isn&#8217;t much different in the markup. I created a
couple of vim macros and went through the pages and updated them accordingly.
The main changes needed were related to the titles of each entry.</simpara>
<simpara>Once the files where moved into the <emphasis>book</emphasis> directory and the format of the
content was setup it was easy to generate the site with one command <literal>git scribe
gen site</literal>. In the <emphasis>output</emphasis> directory was the generated diary nicely formatted
and indexed.</simpara>

<title>Day 7</title>
<simpara>So I have a decent setup for browsing, communicating and writing.</simpara>
<simpara>Now I want to be able to fire off all of my tools in separate windows so that I can easily manage them and keep my work
flow contained.</simpara>
<section id="_setting_up_tmux">
<title>Setting up tmux</title>
<simpara>I already have tmux installed at present, though there will be a point when I
start my dotfiles anew and will properly document the process.</simpara>
<simpara>For now I want to focus on how to automatically spawn a tmux session along with
the default windows I use on a day to day basic.</simpara>
<simpara>I&#8217;m using tmux along with tmuxinator to help manage my setting.</simpara>
<simpara>Installing tmux is done simply by call <literal>brew install tmux</literal> once this has
been installed we are ready to play with tmux. As I mentioned I&#8217;m using
tmuxinator which is a ruby gem so we&#8217;ll add that to our Gemfile:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">gem 'tmuxinator'</literallayout>
<simpara>Running <literal>bundle install</literal> will install tmuxinator and then we are good to go.</simpara>
<simpara>Tmuxinator stores it&#8217;s configuration settings in the <literal>~/.tmuxinator</literal> directory
but we can create a new setup my running <literal>mux create workbench</literal>. I&#8217;ve already
done this so I just ran <literal>mux open workbench</literal> to open the file in vim.</simpara>
<section id="_the_layout">
<title>The layout</title>
<simpara>What I want here is a single session that setups up my perfect setup, allowing
me to make the most of my terminal.</simpara>

<listitem>

done.</simpara>

<listitem>
<simpara>
Spyhole
</simpara>

</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Tmux allows you to capture terminal output, I&#8217;d like to have a window that

functionality will can easily pull out captured content and use it in other
places.</simpara>

it up so automatically check for new emails, though procmail.</simpara>

</section>
<section id="_my_config">

<title>Day 8</title>
<simpara>Today I&#8217;d like to start sketching out how my dotfiles should be setup and maintained. I&#8217;ll also come up with some ideas
as to what my dotfiles will include and how to maintain the core dependencies of them.</simpara>
<simpara>As some of the setup may change from box to box I shouldn&#8217;t have to throw everything into once basket, my dotfiles, I&#8217;d
like to build some scripts that handle the dependencies of the setup and makes it easy for me to continue to tweak it
whilst allowing it to be setup on any box with ease.</simpara>
<section id="_dotfile_blueprints">
<title>Dotfile blueprints</title>
<simpara>So this is where the plan starts to come together.</simpara>
<simpara>My dotfiles should be a collection of settings and utilities that help me with
my day to day work. As time has gone on I&#8217;ve learnt what I like and what I
don&#8217;t and have always like the idea of having one group setting that can go
anywhere. Back in the day my setup was stored on my personal CVS repository,
these days its github.</simpara>
<simpara>NOTE:
This link will need to be changed when we start the new version or clean up the
current.</simpara>
<simpara>I already have my dotfiles <ulink url="https://github.com/baphled/dotfiles">here</ulink>.</simpara>
<simpara>So there are a few thins I&#8217;ll need my dotfiles to have, as follows:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
I must be able to push changes to any of my dotfiles without adding them to
    my actual dotfiles, at present I&#8217;m having to do a lot of copy and pasting

<simpara>

</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>

</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Alert me if my dotfiles or their dependancies are out of date
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
I&#8217;ll start on doing this just for my other dotfiles (dotmutt, dotirssi, etc)
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Create a script to install my dependancies
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
This will start of by focussing on installing things via brew
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Should automatically check for new gems that my dotfiles rely on
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Must include the applications that my dotfiles rely on
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<section id="_the_basics">
<title>The basics</title>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s start from the top, I want the following:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Vim
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Tmux
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
ZSH
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Regardless of what I&#8217;m aiming to do I&#8217;ll need all of these to make my workflow
as productive as possible.</simpara>
<simpara>I&#8217;ll need to branch my current repository so that I can start a fresh, once
this is done, the next thing to do will be to add the dependancies. I may look
into using puppet or chef for this but if that is the case then I will want to
make sure that my dotfiles knows how to do a <literal>bundle install</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>So I guess the first thing will be to install rvm and get that setup so I can
setup ruby.</simpara>
<simpara>I should also document this process so that I can turn it into a script which
makes sure that I have the correct version of ruby and have run bundle.</simpara>
<simpara>So for zsh I&#8217;ll want to use <ulink url="https://github.com/baphled/oh-my-zsh"> oh-my-zsh </ulink>. I&#8217;ll use my own forked version, which
includes my custom theme, and will add it to my newly created dotfiles.</simpara>
<simpara>The main issue at the moment is that if I have made changes to my dotfiles or
any of their sub repositories I&#8217;d like the commit to got to the right
repository and not just be added to my dotfiles.</simpara>
<simpara>I&#8217;m not sure how easy it is to achieve this but this would be the ideal
situation for how I work. It very rare that I know the correct config or
commands or changes for the at matter from the get go and have to spend a
little time tinkering on my local setup before I can commit to anything. So
having to keep track of these changes and copy them to the specific repository
is a pain and error prone.</simpara>

<title>Starting a new</title>
<simpara>So the first thing I&#8217;ll need to do is stripped down my repository so that
I can start a new.</simpara>
<simpara>WARNING:
This can be somewhat hazardious if you rely on having all of your
downloads in your home directory as the following command will remove
everything from your repository and working directory</simpara>
<simpara>This will be used to stripped down my dotvim repository and help me
start from scratch whilst keeping my master branch intacted.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/stripped
rm .git/index
git clean -fdx</literallayout>
<simpara>This took some time and basically removed everything in my home
directory, which I didn&#8217;t really think about prior to running the
command. So going back was not really an option.</simpara>
<simpara>Once the command had finished all my personal setting were removed and I
recieved a bunch of errors relating to RVM not being found. This was
because my zsh settings rely on RVM for prompt information.</simpara>

and running.</simpara>

<title>Installing RVM</title>
<simpara>So the first thing i&#8217;ll need is RVM. This will be needed by my zsh

<simpara>I like to have the latest version of Ruby so I can keep up with what&#8217;s
new in the latest releases.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby</literallayout>
<simpara>This will install the latest version of RVM and Ruby, so I am well on my
way to getting Ruby setup on my system.</simpara>
<simpara>Once rvm and the latest version of Ruby installed I wanted to change my
setup so that the gems installed as part of my dotfiles are now
installed in global, so that they are available everywhere.</simpara>
<simpara>To do this I needed to make sure I was in the global gemset which was
done by using the following command.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">rvm gemset use global</literallayout>
<simpara>Now that I am using the correct gemset, I need to make sure that I run
bundle to make sure that everything is in place.</simpara>

<literallayout class="monospaced">braid
git-scribe
tmuxinator
pry</literallayout>
<simpara>I no longer want to use braid, so I will firstly remove all the external
repositories</simpara>
<simpara>I also have the following external repositories:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">oh-my-zsh
dotirssi
muttfiles
dotvim</literallayout>
<warning><simpara>Removing these files cause a lot of things to break.</simpara></warning>
<simpara>To make sure that I don&#8217;t break anything I can&#8217;t fix imediately, and to
keep my previous setup, I&#8217;ll need to create a new branch</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">gco -b remove_braid</literallayout>
<note><simpara>The above command uses an aliases via oh-my-zsh</simpara></note>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll start off by removing these via braid as follows:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">braid remove oh-my-zsh
braid remove dotirssi
braid remove dotmutt
braid remove dotvim</literallayout>
<simpara>So the most important repository for me is oh-my-zsh it&#8217;s pretty much
invaluable and it would be an idea to get this setup as soon as possible.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git submodule add git@github.com:baphled/oh-my-zsh.git oh-my-zsh
git submodule init
git submodule update</literallayout>
<simpara>Now I have my zsh setup as a submodule I can make changes to the repository and
push them directory to the right repository :)</simpara>
<simpara>The next thing is to do the same for my other repositories</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git submodule add git@github.com:baphled/dotvim.git dotvim
git submodule add git@github.com:baphled/muttfiles.git dotmutt
git submodule add git@github.com:baphled/dotirssi.git dotirssi</literallayout>
<simpara>Now any changes made to my external repositories intermally or externally can
now be easily tracked :)</simpara>
<simpara>The last step in the journey is to remove braid from my Gemfile as it is no
longer needed directly by the repository. That is as easy as removing the line
<literal>gem "braid"</literal> and running <literal>bundle</literal> again.</simpara>
<simpara>Now we have a cleaner repository and less worry in regards to how my other
repositories are updated and managed.</simpara>
<simpara>So now that I am using git&#8217;s submodules to manage my external repositories I
can now make local changes and update the correct repository without polutting
my dotfiles with changes that are not directly related to them.</simpara>

<title>Day 10</title>
<simpara>In my old muttrc file I had procmail getting my mails and storing them in separate folders so that I can work out what
was what and how important it was.  I&#8217;ve long since had this setup and I&#8217;ve pretty much forgotten how it was all setup.</simpara>
<simpara>Today is the day I start getting this setup back, this only be the start I want to be able to view all my email account

<simpara>Procmail and fetchmail are installed on Macs by default so that saves me a

<simpara>So I&#8217;ll have to run the following to get the ball rolling:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">brew install msmtp</literallayout>
<simpara>I then had to add the following to my <literal>.zshrc</literal></simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">MAIL=/home/baphled/mail/inbox &amp;&amp; export MAIL</literallayout>
<simpara>Then  in my home directory I ran:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">touch .fetchmailrc

<simpara>I then needed to poll my main email account

    user <emphasis>EMAILADDRESS</emphasis> keep

<note><simpara>Make sure that <literal>.netrc</literal> is added to <literal>.gitignore</literal></simpara></note>
<simpara>I had to make sure that I had setup my email details properply and to do this I
had to do the following:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">fetchmail</literallayout>
<simpara>Once everything was setup properly fetchmail did it&#8217;s things and retrieved my
email. This is the bare minimum I need to make sure that I have procmail
working so that I can store my email in the right directories.</simpara>
<simpara>I need to then create the mail directory <literal>~/Mail</literal> which is where all my mail

<note><simpara>Add my basic recipes here</simpara></note>
<simpara>I&#8217;d also like to make fetchmail get my latest mail via mutt and not via a

<title>Day 11</title>
<simpara>So my email is being retrieve, manually, so now I&#8217;d like to focus on getting this setup to be retrieved automatically
and work out some procmail recipes so that I my email is nicely organised for me.</simpara>
<section id="_organising_my_email">
<title>Organising my email</title>
<simpara>So like most I get quite a lot of email, varying in importance and
relevance dependant on time. I&#8217;d like to get my old setup back in place
with a few tweaks. Things are pretty much configured so that my email
will be sent to the correct file but I need to improve on these recipes
so that I don&#8217;t have to keep going back and forth over a long period of
time constantly tweaking it.</simpara>
<simpara>There are a few groups I know I&#8217;ll need and as time goes by I will have
to add the odd new recipe but for now I&#8217;ll focus on my personal email
and how to get that under some order.</simpara>
<note><simpara>Link to my first procmailrc</simpara></note>
<simpara>As with others I get quite a lot from various services, these can be
filtered more as time goes on but for now I&#8217;d like a dumping ground
<literal>social</literal> which will store all the unmatched emails that may slip through
procmails net.</simpara>
<simpara>I also like to not see email regarding jobs/roles I&#8217;m not interested in.
Emails that have a given type of subject or come from know offenders
(crappy recruitment consultants) should be sent to <literal>/dev/null</literal> so that I
don&#8217;t have to bother with them. This may need some tweaking but I think
testing my recipes by dry running it against my main email address
should help to get this refined relatively quickly</simpara>
<simpara>I also need a new directory to be created for any discussion groups I
have joined. The idea here is that these will be caught by procmail and
the name of the file will be created based on this. This way I don&#8217;t
have to meddle with procmailrc too much and keeps things nice a clean.</simpara>
<section id="_mailing_lists">
<title>Mailing lists</title>
<simpara>First things was to create a dummy email.</simpara>

<simpara>To do a dry run on my recipes I used the following command:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">procmail VERBOSE=on DEFAULT=/dev/null   \
  LOGFILE=~/test.log                    \
    ~/.procmailrc &lt; ~/emailtest.txt</literallayout>
<simpara>So the first thing I need to do is setup my social related email file.</simpara>
<screen>  :0
  * ^((List-Id|X-(Mailing-)?List):(.*[&lt;]\/[^&gt;]*))
  {
      LISTID=$MATCH

      :0:
      * LISTID ?? ^\/[^@\.]*
      $MATCH

  }</screen>
<simpara>From time to time I find myself on a MAJADOMO mail server so I&#8217;ll add
this in to preempt these occasions.</simpara>
<screen>  # MAJORDOMO - Automagically handle Majordomo lists
  :0
  * ^Sender: owner-[^@]+@[^@\+]+
  * ^Sender: owner-\/[^@\+]+
  {
      :0:
      $MATCH
  }</screen>
<simpara>After doing a dry run the following directory was automatically added to
my Mail directory.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">λ l Mail
total 3187
-rw-------   1 baphled  staff      3187 19 Jul 20:24 FooBar-list</literallayout>
<simpara>Now the problem here is that mutt does not recognise the directory and I
will have to still manually add each one as I notice them into my mutt
file.</simpara>
<simpara>There is a way around this I could make mutt smarter and work out which
directories are inboxes and which are not.</simpara>
<note><simpara>Wrote a script that can easily list the inboxes. Need to automate</simpara></note>

<title>Filtering LinkedIn Discussion groups</title>
<simpara>Now I&#8217;m on a few LinkedIn mailing lists and they don&#8217;t adear to the

LinkedIn originating emails to the appropriate discussion group.</simpara>
<simpara>Getting the regexp just right wasn&#8217;t easy but I finally manage to get it
to work with a little help from the shell.</simpara>
<simpara>I took the same route as I did earlier, copied a same email to the
emailtest.txt file, after a while I came up with the following.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">:0: # Change this so that it sorts by the digest group$
* ^(From):(\/.*).*\&lt;group-digests@linkedin.com\&gt;$
`echo $MATCH | awk '{$NF=`}1' | sed 's/ //g'`$''`</literallayout>
<simpara>The most cryptic is the following line:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">`echo $MATCH | awk '{$NF=`}1' | sed 's/ //g'`$''`</literallayout>
<simpara>Basically I echo the matched address out to the shell which then returns
everything but the last column, in this case it&#8217;s the email address. It
then removes all spaces and we have our directory.</simpara>

<title>Day 12</title>
<simpara>There are a couple of small things that need to be adressed before I introduce my other email accounts. As it stands I
have filtered mail but there is no easy way of getting to my filtered inbox without some hassle. I need to setup a way
to let mutt automatically know which mailboxes I have without having to constantly update my muttrc file.</simpara>
<section id="_update_mailbox_list">
<title>Update mailbox list</title>
<simpara>I had problems trying to get mutt to list all my mail boxes internally
due to my bash noobishness but I did find a way to do it
semi-automatically. I&#8217;d like to improve on this process so that I can
make it a lot easier to be able to keep my inbox list up to date whilst
keeping mutt open.</simpara>
<section id="_the_idea">
<title>The idea</title>
<simpara>So it was pretty easy to create a script that lists all the files in my
mail directory and returns them as a list of arguments. I then loop over
each mailbox and echo out the format needed for mutt to recognise it as
a mailbox.</simpara>
<simpara>Once I have the desired string I then send it to a mutt config file in a
format mutt can recognise.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">mailboxes =inbox =foodie =gaming</literallayout>
</section>
<section id="_bringing_it_to_life">
<title>Bringing it to life</title>
<simpara>This did actually take some time to work out the simplist way of
actually getting a list of mailboxes without having to update my muttrc
everytime one was discovered.</simpara>
<simpara>I knew the best way to do this via the command line but I wasn&#8217;t
completely sure how. I first start off by getting a list of inboxes and
piping the results to xargs so that I could loop over each of them but
this caused a broken pipe error when ran as a subcommand in my muttrc.
After a while of hacking a few concepts I remember how useful sed is in
these situations. I ended up with the below code snippet which actually
did what I wanted for the time being.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">mailboxes `ls -r ~/Mail | xargs | sed 's/ / =/g' | sed 's/inbox/=inbox/'`</literallayout>
<formalpara><title>Hack alert</title><para>[NOTE]:
I&#8217;m aware that this could be improved, ideally I want to prepend a <emphasis>=</emphasis>
to the first word instead of relying on the fact the inbox will always
be the first work back.</para></formalpara>
<simpara>The above comand basically lists all the files in the <literal>~/Mail</literal> directory
and adds them to a list and finally appends <emphasis>=</emphasis> to each inbox. This way
I don&#8217;t have to worry about new inboxes being created and having to keep
track of them. I sinply have to create a new procmail recipe and let
mutt work out where the new inboxes are stored :)</simpara>
<simpara><?asciidoc-pagebreak?></simpara>
<simpara>Now that I have a semi decent mutt setup I&#8217;d like to setup multiple SMTP servers. It&#8217;d be cool if mutt could be
configured so that I could send a reply and the correct SMTP server is used, along with the right response header.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section id="_adding_multiple_smtp_accounts">
<title>Adding multiple SMTP accounts</title>
<simpara>So I have my personal email accounts setup, so now I can read all my emails and
filter them pretty easily. The only thing missing here is being able to respond
to emails with the correct email address.</simpara>
<simpara>So the problem at the moment is that all emails I send are set to my username
and machines hostname (<ulink url="mailto:my.username@my.machines.name.com">my.username@my.machines.name.com</ulink>), which is obviously
what I want, I need to update mutt so that it can tell which email address to
use as the sender.</simpara>
<simpara>This requires quite a bit of setup so I&#8217;ll hold of on doing the actual setup
and work out what I actually need to do to all me to choose which account to
send emails.</simpara>
<simpara>The first thing I&#8217;ll need to do is make sure that the <emphasis>From</emphasis> field in my email

address that the email was sent to.</simpara>
<simpara>I&#8217;m not quite sure how to do this yet so I&#8217;ll put a fork in it for the moment
so that I can focus on getting the rest of my setup functional.</simpara>

<title>Day 13</title>
<simpara>I&#8217;d like to organise my RSS feeds into mutt or an alternative news reader so that I can easily keep up with current
tech. Today I&#8217;ll dedicate some time into getting this setup.</simpara>
<section id="_getting_a_feed_reader">
<title>Getting a feed reader</title>
<simpara>So the next step along this journey is to setup a news reader. I&#8217;ve looked at a
few that I used to use in the past.</simpara>
<simpara>I stumbled on <ulink url="https://github.com/posativ/homebrew-newsbeuter">newsbeuter</ulink> which
is a cli with a mutt feel. Ideal for me as I&#8217;m an avid mutt user.</simpara>
<simpara>Unfortunately brew can&#8217;t find newsbeuter by it&#8217;s self so I needed to tell it
where it is and then install it on my system.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">brew tap posativ/homebrew-newsbeuter</literallayout>
<simpara>This installs the brew formula needed to install newsbeuter. Once this was complete all I had to do is run:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">brew install newsbeuter</literallayout>
<simpara>Again I had to wait, this time for newsbeuter to install, and then I was ready
to play with newsbeuter.</simpara>
<simpara>I use GoogleReader for all my RSS feeds so I needed the following in my
<literal>~/.newsbeuter/config</literal> file.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">urls-source "googlereader"
googlereader-login "your-googlereader-account"</literallayout>
<simpara>I also wanted to be able to share and star articles so I also added the following mappings</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">googlereader-flag-share "a"
googlereader-flag-star "b"</literallayout>
<note><simpara>Need a way to not have to disclose my google user id.</simpara></note>
<simpara>Once I started <literal>newsbeuter</literal> I had an empty list of feeds that I have subscribed
to in the past. The only thing left for me to do was to press <emphasis>R</emphasis> and wait for
all of my feeds to update :)</simpara>
<simpara>Navigating through feeds is similar to vi but I&#8217;d like to actually have the
basic bindings in place so that I don&#8217;t have to keep changing context.</simpara>
<simpara>It would also be cool if I could tweak the layout so that it looked more like
my mutt setup. I&#8217;m not sure on how easy this but I&#8217;ll look into this and see
how easy it is to achieve.</simpara>
<simpara>It&#8217;s important to be able to view links easily, I&#8217;ll continue to use w3m as my
browser of choice as it is already configured and working pretty well.
newsbeuter also has podcast support :) so I can keep up to date with my
podcasts without having to rely on itunes.</simpara>
<simpara>In my <literal>~/.newsbeuter/config</literal> file I added the following:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">browser w3m</literallayout>
<simpara>Now that is setup I can easily open links by proving the number associated to
the link of interest.</simpara>

<title>Day 14</title>
<simpara>Braid is causing me hassle and as part of cleaning up my dotvim files I want to replace braid with git submodule. This
will be part of the cleanup needed for dotvim files in preparation of me improving my vim skills.</simpara>
<section id="_removing_vims_braid">
<title>Removing VIMs braid</title>
<simpara>So I&#8217;ve been using braid to manage my vim plugins but I&#8217;d prefer if I used git
directly as I am with my dotfiles. The first thing to do is keep a list of all
of the plugins that I have, I&#8217;ll need this so that I can keep the plugins I am
currently using.</simpara>
<simpara>I&#8217;ll be using the following command to add each plugin as a git module:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git submodule add git://github.com/username/project.git plugin/path</literallayout>
<simpara>All but one of the plugins live in the <literal>bundle</literal> direction the only exception is
vim-pathogen with lives in the parent directory of my dotvim repository. So the
command I need should output the following formats</simpara>

<simpara>This is enough to work with for the moment, I can easily do set this up so that
I don&#8217;t have to manually add each plugin using git submodule. I need the
following format to successfully add each plugin using git.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git submodule add git://github.com/username/project.git plugin/path</literallayout>
<simpara>Running the following command gives me the output I want:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">cat .braids | grep 'url' | sed 's/url://' | awk -F/ '{print $0, $5}' &gt; ~/vim-plugins.txt</literallayout>
<simpara>Now that I have a list of repos that I will want to add as submodules. With a
little vim trickery I can whip and basic bash script to automatically add my
plugins.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">vi ~/vim-plugins.txt</literallayout>
<simpara>I normal mode I type the following:
  V38j
  :'&lt;,'&gt;normal f i bundle/
  :%s/bundle\ //bundle\//g</simpara>
<simpara>This will prefix bundle/ to all lines, but the last, to the 2 column.
vim-pathogen is saved to the parent directory.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">:'&lt;,'&gt;normal I git submodule add</literallayout>
<simpara>Now I have the necessary list and location for all my plugins. I&#8217;d like to
reverse the list to make sure that pathogen gets install first.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">awk '{x[NR] = $0} END { while ( NR &gt; 0 ) print x[NR--] }' vim-plugins.txt &gt; plugins.txt &amp;&amp; vim-plugins.txt</literallayout>
<simpara>This will use awk to reverse my plugin list as I wanted. Now it&#8217;s time to
remove all the plugins via braid. Then I can then add my plugins again using
git&#8217;s submodules.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">cat .braids | grep ': $' | sed 's/://' &gt; ~/plugins.txt | for plugin in `xargs`; do; rm -rf $plugin; done</literallayout>
<simpara>The above command creates the output needed to remove all of my plugins that
were installed via braid.</simpara>
<simpara>Finally I just have to execute the script I created that will add all my
plugins using <literal>git submodule</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Once this was done all I had to do is comit my changes and pull them in and I
have no more need for braid anymore.</simpara>

<title>Day 15</title>
<simpara>So I now have a news reader so the only thing left to setup are my podcasts.  I&#8217;ve been using itunes of late and would
like to move away from that and see what newsbeuter has to offer in the way of helping me to keep up with podcasts.</simpara>
<section id="_managing_my_podcasts">
<title>Managing my podcasts</title>
<simpara>Now is the time that I move my podcasts from iTunes back to the console, where
they belong. I&#8217;ve already installed newsbeuter so I can use that to track the
podcasts I listen to and handling queuing and downloading them.</simpara>
<simpara>This is pretty simple really, first off I needed to add a podcasts to my feed
list. I then checkout any new items via newsbeuter which picked up the podcast
and listed it as expected. The next step is to queue up the latest podcast and
listen to it via podbeuter. Pressing <literal>e</literal> enqueues the podcast which will add
the podcast to the queue for downloading. Opening <literal>podbeuter</literal> showed me the
podcast in the queue allowing me to press <literal>a</literal> to start the download.</simpara>
<simpara>Here&#8217;s the changes I needed to get podbeuter to download and listen to my
podcasts.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">download-path       ~/Downloads
max-downloads       2
player              afplay</literallayout>
<simpara>Pressing <literal>p</literal> inside podbeuter actually plays the selected audio file and then
we&#8217;re away. Podcast management from the command line :).</simpara>
<section id="_adding_podbeuter_to_my_workflow">
<title>Adding podbeuter to my workflow</title>
<simpara>As this has been described in previous entries this part is straight forward
and only requires a reference to my <literal>~/tmuxinator/workbench.yml</literal> file. I simply
add a new <emphasis>Podcast</emphasis> window next to my <emphasis>Newsfeed</emphasis> window. Keeping all my
communications close together.</simpara>

<section id="_splitting_my_workbench">
<title>Splitting my workbench</title>
<simpara>My workbench is starting to get cluttered now and it is becoming increasingly
clear that I have two types of workflow living in the same session. Ideally I&#8217;d
like to have my commucation based workflows in a single session whilst my
workbench and hacking session is in another.</simpara>
<simpara>this is pretty easy, the only thing I raelly need to think about is how these
two sessions will be started.</simpara>
<simpara>Firstly I remove the  communications related sessions into a new tmux configure
file as follows:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">project_name: comms
project_root: ~/
rvm: 1.9.2-head@global
pre: cd ~/ &amp;&amp; bundle
tabs:
  - Interwepts: w3m http://google.com
  - IRC: irssi
  - "Newsfeed": newsbeuter
  - "Podcasts": podbeuter
  - Email: mutt
  - Spyhole: tail -f ~/comms.log
  - "Dotfile Diaries": cd ~/Documents/Diary &amp;&amp; vi book/book.asc
  - Top: top</literallayout>
<simpara>This leaves me with the following <emphasis>workbench</emphasis> setup:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">project_name: workbench
project_root: ~/
rvm: 1.9.2-head@global
pre: cd ~/ &amp;&amp; bundle
tabs:
  - Workbench: vim
  - Spyhole: tail -f ~/workbench.log
  - Toybox: be pry
  - 'Control centre': git wtf</literallayout>
<simpara>I now have two separate sessions to deal with my main two workflows further
helping me to keep my workflows focussed and without switching context too
much. Now I need to make sure that I can load these two sessions easily whilst
keeping their session location in guessable positions.</simpara>
<simpara>All I need to do is add the following to my <literal>.zlogin</literal> file:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">mux comms &amp;&amp; mux workbench</literallayout>
<simpara>This will automatically start both sessions as soon as I start a zsh session.
This could be moved to <literal>.profile</literal> if needed but for the moment I won&#8217;t worry
too much about that as I tend to use zsh more than anything else.</simpara>
<simpara>Once this is done I make sure that I only start iTerm with a default session
and let <literal>.zlogin</literal> do the rest of the work.</simpara>

<title>Day 16</title>
<simpara>The first thing I&#8217;m going to need to do is delete my old repository and create a new one with the same name. This will
bork my <literal>dotfile</literal> repository submodule but I can easily fix that by either updating the reference manually or removing
and reinstall the plugin via the command line.</simpara>
<simpara>Before I do this I want to move some of my settings around so that they can be easily added or left out if I desire. My
aim here is to make it easier to choose the vim setup I prefer.</simpara>
<simpara>My initial setup will be a bare bones version of Vim with little to none plugins added. As I gain more proficiency I
will gradually add plugins to my workflow to help enhance the keystokes I have already learnt. The first of these will
focus on text objects and then I will focus on movements and making project wide changes.</simpara>
<simpara>I will stick with plugins that enhance the mime types available to me and help with some basic formatting. Once I have
this under my belt I will start to delve into VIML and creating my own plugins and tweaks.</simpara>
<simpara>Whilst doing all this I will be picking up a Practical Vim tip a day to help me productivity. These will generally be
separate entries and will go over what I&#8217;ve learnt and how the new skill could be used to improve how I work.</simpara>
<section id="_cleaning_up_my_vim_settings">
<title>Cleaning up my vim settings</title>
<simpara>So I&#8217;ve customised my vim settings quite a bit based on
<ulink url="https://github.com/astrails/dotvim">astrails dotvim</ulink> repository. My changes have
diverged quite abit and I&#8217;d rather break them from the branch and start a
fresh. This will lead the way for me stripping down my settings and finding
ways to easily get used to using vim without all the bells and whistles.</simpara>
<simpara>The first thing I need to do is detach from the origination repository and make
sure that my changes are kept in place. Once this is done I can then create a
config setting to not use and plugins and use a base set of configuration
settings so that I can start to improve my basic Vim skills.</simpara>
<simpara>I had to go to github and delete the repository. Once deleted I created a new
repository with the same name and push the repository</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git push</literallayout>
<simpara>I now have a repository that is not forked to astrails. I still need to let my
dotfiles know that the repository is update and has changed so I need to do the
following</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">gup</literallayout>
<simpara>This detached the head of the repository, which is easy enough to fix, as long
as there are no local changes.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">g co master</literallayout>
<simpara>Now that the repository is up to date all I need to do is update my <literal>dotfiles</literal>
to reflect the changes to the detached repository.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">cd ~
ga dotvim
g ci -m 'Update my dotvim files'</literallayout>
<simpara>Now the repository is up to date and my dotfiles know of the change I&#8217;ve just
made.</simpara>
<simpara>Finally I push the change to my dotfiles and everything is all set.</simpara>

<title>Tweaking my test function</title>
<simpara>So I have a few custom bindings to run work out what kind of test I am
running and run it with the right tool.</simpara>
<simpara>This has proved quite useful in the past allowing me to run <literal>&lt;leader&gt;t</literal>
to run the current or last run test file. The other binding is set to
<literal>&lt;leader&gt;T</literal> which runs the closest test to the current line number.</simpara>
<simpara>These have served me well up to today when I had some performance
testing to do and testunit was the only tool setup for the project I was
working on.</simpara>
<note><simpara>Find link to Gary&#8217;s dotfiles.</simpara></note>
<simpara>My bindings were originally stolen from "Gary Bernhardt&#8217;s dotfiles" and
was tweaked by myself to include cucumber. Now it&#8217;s time to fix the
issue with testunit.</simpara>
<simpara>To run my unit tests I will need the following command:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">exec ":!bundle exec ruby -I\"lib:test\" " . a:filename "</literallayout>
<simpara>This runs my unit test in the correct environemnt. There is one issue
with this. The firstly the other tool we can simple run the test we are
interested with by appending <emphasis>:1</emphasis> where <emphasis>1</emphasis> is the line number. The
issue with doing this with my unittests is that it is not the expected
command and will error out.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">:!bundle exec ruby -I"lib:test" test/performance/browsing_test.rb:9
ruby: No such file or directory -- test/performance/browsing_test.rb:9
(LoadError)</literallayout>
<literallayout class="monospaced">shell returned 1</literallayout>
<literallayout class="monospaced">Press ENTER or type command to continue</literallayout>
<simpara>this isn&#8217;t what I want in this case and it would be cool o actually get
this to work properly as it is a large part of my typical development
workflow.</simpara>
<simpara>To do this I will need to be able to capture the method name relating to
the unit test file. To do this I will need to capture the number and get
the contents of the first and last 5 lines on either side of the line
number received. What ever the closest method name is we&#8217;ll use to run a
single unit test.</simpara>
<simpara>I&#8217;ll focus on this another day once I have improve my VIML.</simpara>

<simpara>Firstly I&#8217;ll start by adding <emphasis>vim-refactoring</emphasis> to dotfiles.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git submodule add git://github.com/ecomba/vim-ruby-refactoring.git bundle/vim-ruby-refactoring</literallayout>

<simpara><emphasis>vim-refactoring</emphasis> has some lengthly mapping but they turn out to be quite useful too.</simpara>

<title>Adding ctags</title>
<simpara>First off i&#8217;ll need to install ctags.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">brew install ctags</literallayout>
<simpara>Now ctags needs to know where the methods and classes live so i&#8217;ll need a way
to get file locations easily. I found the following snip from
<ulink url="http://andrewradev.com/2011/06/08/vim-and-ctags/">here</ulink> so I&#8217;ll copy and paste
the following snippet into my ~/bin/generate-rails-gem-tags</simpara>
<note><simpara>I&#8217;d prefer the script to be stored within my dotvim but I&#8217;ll deal with that later.</simpara></note>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">  #! /usr/bin/env ruby

  # Generate all tags for all gems included by bundler in gems.tags
  #
  # Basically does the same as "bundle show gemname", except for all gems.
  # Interestingly enough, "bundle show" without any arguments falls back to
  # "bundle list", otherwise the whole thing could have been a bash one-liner.
  require 'bundler'

  paths = Bundler.load.specs.map(&amp;:full_gem_path)

  system("ctags -R -f gems.tags #{paths.join(' ')}")</programlisting>
<simpara>I have to make sure that this is executable.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">chmod u+x ~/bin/generate-rails-gem-tags</literallayout>
<simpara>This will index all the gems I&#8217;ve installed via bundle. I&#8217;ll also need to add
the projects files to the index.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">ctags -R .</literallayout>
<simpara>It would be nice if this was done automatically when I cd into a project
directory or could be handled with tmux when I start a new project session. For
the moment I&#8217;ll just bind this command to a mapping something like:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">noremap &lt;leader&gt;ct :!ctags -R .&lt;CR&gt;</literallayout>
<simpara>To keep my tags up to date I&#8217;ll se <emphasis>autotag</emphasis> which depends on python but allows
me to keep my tags up to date and removes tags that are no longer needed.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git submodule add git://github.com/vim-scripts/AutoTag.git bundle/auto-tag</literallayout>
<simpara>So now I have the basics setup I need to work out how to navigate through the
tags easily without looking where I originally was.</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>&lt;C-]&gt;</literal> - Go to the first found definition

<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>:tselect</literal> - List all the found definitions
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Trying to move around tags can be quite a strain so I&#8217;ll add some custom
mappings to navigate through them easily.</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>]t</literal> - next tag
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>

<simpara>Today I&#8217;m going to work on my navigation and manipulation of files and content.</simpara>
<section id="_tweaking_nerdtree">
<title>Tweaking Nerdtree</title>
<simpara>So I&#8217;ve played with Nerdtree in the past but dropped it to make sure of
Netrw. I&#8217;ve done this for a number of weeks but I still prefer Nerdtree
so I&#8217;ll be reinstalling it and updating my settings.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git submodule add git://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git bundle/nerdtree</literallayout>
<simpara>I also add the following so that NERDTree is loaded automatically if no
files are opened when starting vim.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">autocmd vimenter * if !argc() | NERDTree | endif</literallayout>
<simpara>That&#8217;s it, it couldn&#8217;t be easier. All that is left is to map NERDTree to a
binding so that it is easy to call.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">:noremap &lt;C-p&gt; :NERDTreeToggle&lt;CR&gt;</literallayout>
<simpara>I&#8217;ll also need to cancel out <emphasis>Ctrl-P</emphasis> default binding so that they don&#8217;t clash.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">let g:ctrlp_map = '&lt;unique&gt; &lt;silent&gt; &lt;Leader&gt;&lt;Leader&gt;'</literallayout>
<simpara>As Ctrl-P uses &lt;C-p&gt; as a default mapping I just change this so that it it uses
double &lt;leader&gt; leaving Nerdtree to freely use &lt;C-p&gt;.</simpara>

<title>Being unimpaired</title>
<simpara>Now I have my ctags setup and I&#8217;m nearly complete with setting up my essentials
for my day to day work, I will finially install <emphasis>unimpaired</emphasis>.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git submodule add git://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired.git bundle/vim-unimpaired</literallayout>
<simpara>I forgot to add this when I removed bundle and a couple of my custom bindings
relay on the plugin to help move lines around.</simpara>
<simpara>Now I have to do some tweaking to custom bindings so that they work without my
cursor keys as those have been disabled in Insert and Visual model.</simpara>
<simpara>Originally I had the following mappings for moving files up and down. This
functionality emulated textmates line mnaipulation functionality and allowed me
to easily move selections of lines around easily without poluting my paste
buffer.</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>&lt;C-Up&gt;</literal> - Move a line up
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>&lt;C-Down&gt;</literal> - Move a line down
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>These are set for both Normal and Visual mode so that I can move single and
multiple lines easily.</simpara>
<simpara>I still don&#8217;t want to encourage the use of my cursor keys so I will remap these
to the following:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>&lt;C-K&gt;</literal> - Move a line up
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>&lt;C-J&gt;</literal> - Move a line down
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Now instead of having to use &lt;Up&gt; and &lt;Down&gt; I can use J and K as I do with
most of my other vim motions.</simpara>

<title>Carry on where I left off</title>
<simpara>It&#8217;s been annoying me for a while but I have dealt with the pain up until now.
When I close a buffer and revisit it I&#8217;d like to have the cursor placed exactly
where I left it when I closed the file. For some reason this functionality
doesn&#8217;t come out of the box but it does tell you how to do it.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">augroup vimrcEx

<section id="_removing_some_pain">
<title>Removing some pain</title>
<simpara>I&#8217;ve been missing my snippets for a while now, I have snipmate installed
but I have limited snippets installed and setup.</simpara>
<simpara>To resolve this I&#8217;ll install <emphasis>snipmate-snippets</emphasis> to start with. Once I
have had a play with those I will later create my own for snippets that
I feel is missing.</simpara>
<simpara>I&#8217;m actually going to fork this project so that I can keep my custom
snippets all in one place. That and I don&#8217;t want/need all the other
snippets that come with the original version.</simpara>
<simpara>The version I chose was relatively new and included snippets for
jasmine and a range of ruby snippets, which was a plus.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">http://github.com/honza/snipmate-snippets</literallayout>
<simpara>Once forked I added my custom fork.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git submodule add git://github.com/baphled/snipmate-snippets.git bundle snipmate-snippets</literallayout>
<simpara>I will need to remove <emphasis>vim-snipmate-ruby-snippets</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>I need to remove the instance from <emphasis>.gitmodules</emphasis></simpara>
<note><simpara>Add lines I had to remove in my .gitmodules file</simpara></note>
<literallayout class="monospaced">rm -rf ../.git/modules/dotvim/modules/bundle/vim-snipmate-ruby-snippets</literallayout>
<literallayout class="monospaced">g ci -m 'update snippets'</literallayout>
<simpara>Updates my dotvims and includes the new snippets plugin.</simpara>
<simpara>I&#8217;d like to build up on these and strip them down for my own needs. This will
more than likely include writing my own where there are missing shortcuts I&#8217;d
like.</simpara>
<simpara>I also need to learn the snippets that are present. The only way to actually do
this is to actually use them. The best type of snippet are the ones that just
rolls off of your fingers. So I expect there to be snippets for <emphasis>def</emphasis>, <emphasis>class</emphasis>,
<emphasis>desc</emphasis>, etc. As I also do quite a bit of writing in Vim I&#8217;d like to make sure I
know that AsciiDoc and Markdown snippets.</simpara>
<simpara>At the moment my forked version doesn&#8217;t have any snippets for AsciiDoc so I
will have to search for some and merge them into my version and updated my
submodules.</simpara>
<simpara>It seems that I am getting warnings about snippets already being defined. I
need to look into this to see how I can supress the messages and stop them from
happening all together.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_tweaking_snipmate">
<title>Tweaking snipmate</title>
<simpara>So the current version of snipmate I already contains some snippets which are
causing me to see warnings. This can be resolved by changing the repository
I pull from with a version of snipmate that doesn&#8217;t include any snippets.</simpara>
<simpara>I&#8217;ll omit removing the actual module as it has been documented already and jump
straight into adding the new repository.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git submodule add git://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate.git bundle/vim-snipmate</literallayout>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git submodule add git://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-mw-utils.git bundle/vim-addon-mw-utils</literallayout>
<simpara>Now we have no warnings and we have a nice base to start adding custom snippets
the only issue is when I &lt;TAB&gt; I get an error stating I need tlib to be
installed. That&#8217;s a bit of of red herring as we actually need tlib-vim.</simpara>

<title>Install gist-vim</title>
<simpara>As I don&#8217;t have this installed for some reason and I&#8217;m due to starting
reviewing my vim packages, I thought I&#8217;d start with gist-vim. I tend to need to
post gists quickly and I usually end up using vim to write these notes and
snippets.</simpara>
<simpara>The only problem with this is that I have to go find the file and then copy and
paste the contents via the website. That&#8217;s kinda slow and annoying. I&#8217;ve used
gist-vim in the past so it&#8217;s time to get that setup and running so that I can
send my gists easier.</simpara>
<simpara>Same as usual I start by install the plugin:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git submodule add git://github.com/mattn/gist-vim.git bundle/gist-vim</literallayout>
<simpara>I also need <literal>webapi-vim</literal> which deal with the API calls to github. As I don&#8217;t
need to install it, as it&#8217;s already installed I&#8217;ll gloss over how it was
installed as it is just a case of adding the plugin and forgetting about it.</simpara>
<simpara>My <literal>plugin.vim</literal> doesn&#8217;t have any settings for <literal>gist-vim</literal> so I&#8217;ll add them now
and then go over the basic commands I&#8217;ll need to play around with gist via vim.</simpara>
<simpara>I want to be able to copy snippets from a gist:
  let g:gist_clip_command = <emphasis>pbcopy</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>I also want to try to detect the file type gists should be when uploading them:
  let g:gist_detect_filetype = 1</simpara>
<simpara>The default command is <literal>:Gist</literal> and <literal>:'&lt;,'&gt;Gist</literal> with the following flags for
the various options:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>-p</literal> - a private gist
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>-P</literal> - a public gist
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>-m</literal> - save a gist with all the buffers
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>-e</literal> - edit the gist in the current buffer
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>-d</literal> - delete a gist
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>-l</literal> - list my gists
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>-l username</literal> - list a users gists
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>I could map a few of these commands but I&#8217;ll hold off on that for the moment
and just get accustomed to calling it manually.</simpara>

<simpara>I&#8217;ve had this installed pretty much from day one and never really used it. I
guess I typically store my notes in gists or evernotes. The latter I have not
got a plugin for, this will go on the <emphasis>to get</emphasis> list.</simpara>
<simpara>Pastie basically does the same as gist-vim put post the content of a buffer(s)
to pastie. As I don&#8217;t have any need for this functionality I&#8217;ll remove it from
my dotvim.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">vi .gitmodules
/ pastie&lt;CR&gt;
d2j
:wq</literallayout>
<simpara>This will open <literal>.gitmodules</literal> in vim find the word <emphasis>pastie</emphasis> and delete that line
and the 2 below it. Finally we save the changes and quit the file.</simpara>
<simpara>Next I needed to remove the plugin manually with <literal>git rm bundle/vim-pastie</literal></simpara>

<simpara>So today I&#8217;ll be looking at <emphasis>Autotag</emphasis> and <emphasis>syntastic</emphasis> which are the programming related plugins that I use when working

<section id="_what_is_autotag">
<title>What is Autotag</title>
<simpara>This has been breifly touch on when adding my
<ulink url="day_18.html#_adding_ctags">ctags</ulink> though I haven&#8217;t really spoken about
what it actually does and what it&#8217;s benefits are.</simpara>
<simpara>Firstly, the first issue with updating ctags is that when running <literal>ctags -a</literal>
you&#8217;d only update the current tags list whilst not removing tags that are no
longer needed.</simpara>
<simpara>Autotag updates the ctags for a project everytime a file is saved. This is
needed so that my ctags don&#8217;t become stale and include definitions that are no
longer present in the project I am currently working on. Meaning that when
pressing <literal>&lt;C-]&gt;</literal> I only get results that are relevent to the project and don&#8217;t
have to sift through a load of useless results.</simpara>
<simpara>Autotag requires <emphasis>Python</emphasis> support so it is important to have support for this
in my <emphasis>Vim</emphasis>. Thankfully if my Vim doesn&#8217;t support <emphasis>Python</emphasis> then it doesn&#8217;t not
fail horribly. These saves me from having to clear my tags manually and just
focus on the task at hand, writing code.</simpara>
<simpara><?asciidoc-pagebreak?></simpara>
</section>
<section id="_syntastic">
<title>Syntastic</title>
<simpara>I use this to help me find syntax errors easily, it doesn&#8217;t do this on the fly
but I save often enough for that not to be a problem. All that is needed is for
a file to be saved and if any errors are found the quickbox buffer will open up
allowing for me to go over each change and deal with them appropriately.
Syntastic comes with a host of syntax checker and the basic to allow for me to
easily add more checkers dependent on the filetype I am dealing with.</simpara>
<simpara>It uses the built in Vim commands for navigation or errors <literal>:lnext</literal> and
<literal>:lprev</literal>. As I&#8217;m using unimpaired I have alternative mappings for these as follows:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>[l</literal> - <literal>:lnext</literal>
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>l]</literal> - <literal>:lprevious</literal>
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Other mime type related plugins also add their own checkers so I have pretty
much all the checkers I need for the moment. The following languages are
included out of the box. The following is just a few that are maintained that I am interest in:</simpara>

<simpara>I&#8217;ve had this plugin for a while plugin for a while but I&#8217;ve only just
scratched the surface of what I can actually do with it.</simpara>
<simpara>I typically only use the commenting part of this plugin and at that the
very basic.</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>&lt;leader&gt;/</literal> - comments out a line
</simpara>
</listitem>

<simpara>I tend to use Visual mode to select the lines I want to comment out and
use the above to get the job done. There is however a better way of
doing this.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">X&lt;leader&gt;c</literallayout>
<simpara>Where <literal>X</literal> is the number of lines you want to comment out.</simpara>
<simpara>I&#8217;ve noticed that <literal>&lt;leader&gt;cy</literal> is a pretty cool too as it comments out a
line but yanks its content first so that you can past is elsewhere. This
is typically useful if you need to modify a line but also want to keep
the orginal commented out but want to past the line or a modified
version of it somewhere else. As with <literal>&lt;leader&gt;c</literal> <literal>&lt;leader&gt;cy</literal> can be
prefixed with a number allowing you to yank and then copy as many
consecutive lines as you please.</simpara>
<simpara>There is also <literal>&lt;leader&gt;cA</literal> which also comments out a line but also
enters you into Insert mode at the end of a line ready to make a change.
This is also accompanied by <literal>&lt;leader&gt;c$</literal> which does the same but puts
you at the start of the line.</simpara>

<simpara>I&#8217;ve been using asciidoc to write this diary.</simpara>
<simpara>As I use vim for my editor of choice I wanted a plugin that would
highlight the asciidoc syntax for me asciidoc-vim allows gives me just
that, making it easier to view asciidoc based content with nice syntax
highlighting.</simpara>
<simpara>It doesn&#8217;t come with any snippets which would be cool but I guess that&#8217;s
not much of a problem as I can always create my own. For the moment it&#8217;s
enough just having syntax highlighting so I&#8217;ll leave the creating custom
snippets for another time.</simpara>

<simpara>As with asciidoc I spend sometime adding content to wiki&#8217;s. The is cool
and all but again I tend to use vim and rather not deal with web
interfaces if I can help it.</simpara>
<simpara>Like <emphasis>asciidoc-vim</emphasis>, <emphasis>vimwiki</emphasis> handling syntax highlighting but it also
comes with a few key bindings to make easy to pull down wiki pages and
upload them when necessary.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">normal mode:
&lt;Leader&gt;ww -- Open default wiki index file.
&lt;Leader&gt;ws -- Select and open wiki index file.
&lt;Leader&gt;wd -- Delete wiki file you are in.

<simpara>I don&#8217;t usually have the need to pull down wiki pages and and make

<simpara>Here&#8217;s a list of plugins I use that will be enhanced by adding this plugin:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
surround.vim
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
abolish.vim
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
unimpaired.vim
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>These plugins are also enhanced though I do not currently use them.</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
speeddating.vim
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
commentary.vim
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>It also allows me to add this functionality to oher plugins by adding
the following code snippet to the my custom bindings.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">silent! call repeat#set("\&lt;Plug&gt;MyWonderfulMap", v:count)</literallayout>
<simpara>Where MyWonderfulMap is the name of the command I&#8217;d like to add repeat
functionality to. It&#8217;s that simple.</simpara>
<simpara>Later once I have completed this section I&#8217;ll take a step back and have
more of a play with this plugin and determine commands that would
benefit from such functionality.</simpara>

</sidebar>
<simpara>This plugin is yet another enhancement, it helps by displaying a popup
for text completions. This is nice as it helps be to quickly type words
that are already with my buffer with little effort.</simpara>
<simpara>There is one issue I currently have with this plugin and that is being
able to press <literal>&lt;Tab&gt;</literal> and <literal>&lt;Shift&gt;+&lt;Tab&gt;</literal> to loop through possible
options. As it stand the defaults are <literal>&lt;Ctrl-N</literal> and <literal>&lt;Ctrl-P&gt;</literal>.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">:set completeopt=longest,menu</literallayout>
<simpara>I could possibly remap the defaults to <literal>&lt;Tab&gt;</literal> and <literal>&lt;Shift&gt;+&lt;Tab&gt;</literal>
respectively but I&#8217;d like to give <literal>supertab</literal> a try. I&#8217;ll document that
in my next entry.</simpara>

</sidebar>
<simpara>So this plugin will help enhance my autocompletion functionality. As stated in
my previous entry I&#8217;d like to be able to use tabs to loop through my completion
list when it comes up. Supertab does this for me so I&#8217;ll have a play with that
and see how it pans out.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git submodule add git://github.com/ervandew/supertab.git bundle/vim-supertab</literallayout>
<simpara>Once this was completed I just had to restart my vim session.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">let g:SuperTabCrMapping=0</literallayout>
<simpara>As I&#8217;m using <emphasis>delimitMate</emphasis> I need the above setting so that <emphasis>supertab</emphasis> does not
conflict with it.</simpara>
<simpara>Now everything is setup I can use tabs as I I&#8217;d like to.</simpara>

<simpara>So I remove the following from my <emphasis>binding.vim</emphasis>:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">nmap &lt;leader&gt;j :cn&lt;CR&gt;
nmap &lt;leader&gt;k :cp&lt;CR&gt;</literallayout>
<simpara>I can also remove the custom mappings I added on

<simpara>One of the most useful motions will be moving to the next and previous conflict

<title>Removing supertab</title>
<simpara>So I&#8217;ve discovered some issues with using <emphasis>supertab</emphasis> conflicting with <emphasis>snipmate</emphasis> and to be quite honest though I used to
use tabs for autocompletion but I my vim muscle memory is used to using <literal>&lt;C-n&gt;</literal> and <literal>&lt;C-p&gt;</literal> to loop through possible
selections. There is also the factor that I <emphasis>am</emphasis> used to using tabs for completing snippets.</simpara>
<simpara>The other consideration is that I still want to try to keep my underlining settings as similar to vanilla vim as
possible whilst tweaking it another for extra productivity.</simpara>
<simpara>So removing <emphasis>supertab</emphasis> seems like a good idea. So with that said I&#8217;m going to remove supertab.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">rm -rf ~/.git/modules/dotvim/modules/bundle/vim-supertab/

<title>Reviewing omnicomplete</title>
<simpara>Since I tweaked omnicomplete I&#8217;ve noticed that it can be quite slow, especially when one of my open buffers has long
strings in the content. I&#8217;d like to tweak this so that I don&#8217;t have to wait for omnicomplete to parse these long string
which is one of the pains I am not fond of at all.</simpara>
<simpara>I&#8217;ll have a look at <literal>neocomplecache</literal> which cache words in my buffer and uses that to populate my omnicomplete lists.
This though may well use more memory that the previous solutions I&#8217;ve used but I won&#8217;t really know how much so until I
actually start using it. Though this seems like a relatively sane idea for improving the speed in which omnicomplete
finds long strings.</simpara>
<simpara>There is one thing that I need to look out for and that is that noecomplcache caches content so the long strings I&#8217;m
currently having issues with maywell cause my machines to slow down as noecomplcache attempts to retrieve data from the
cache.</simpara>
<simpara>As there are a few unknowns I need to checkout I&#8217;ll hold out on setting neocomplecache right now and leave it for
another day once I have gone through the rest of the currently installed plugins.</simpara>

<title>Day 27</title>
<simpara>Today i&#8217;ll be looking at the plugins that help tweak my file navigation functionality. These help me to find and manage
files quickly and help me to manage the buffers I have open.</simpara>
<simpara><?asciidoc-pagebreak?></simpara>
<section id="_bufexplorer">
<title>bufexplorer</title>
<sidebar>
<literallayout class="monospaced">plugin: bufexplorer
home:   http://github.com/c9s/bufexplorer
source: git://github.com/c9s/bufexplorer.git</literallayout>
</sidebar>
<simpara>So dealing with buffers can be somewhat frustrating at times, especially if you
keep a session running for a number of days, as I do, the one thing missing
from Vim is a way to easily navigation open buffers and manage them as needed.</simpara>
<simpara>I came across bufexplorer a few weeks ago whilst watching another developer
coding and flipping buffers. After looking at their vim files I noticed that
they had been using bufexplorer to do this and quickly added it to my
toolchain. It&#8217;s easy to configure and adds the nice feature of being able to
list buffers and select and delete them quite easily.</simpara>
<simpara>The first things I did was to remap its default (<literal>&lt;leader&gt;be</literal>) to <literal>&lt;leader&gt;,.</literal>
mainly as the former feels more natural. There are a few more mappings that it
uses that I haven&#8217;t gotten around to making use of yet and it will be these
that I&#8217;ll be playing around with from now on. They are as follows:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">&lt;leader&gt;bs
&lt;leader&gt;bv</literallayout>
<simpara>As you may or may not of figured out this opens bufexplorer in a horizontal and
vertical split respectively.</simpara>
<simpara>The most common command I use at present is deleting buffers (<literal>d</literal>) and jumping
to a given buffer. The former still feels a little clumsy, probably as I&#8217;m not
making the use of the out of the box commands and defaulting to using search to
find a buffer and press <literal>&lt;Enter&gt;</literal> when I&#8217;ve found the buffer I am interested in.</simpara>
<simpara>Below is a snippet of the docs which lists some of the internal commands
bufexplorer supports:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">R             Toggles relative path/absolute path.
D            |:wipeout|the buffer under the cursor from the list.  When a
              buffers is wiped, it will not be shown when unlisted buffer are
              displayed.
f             Toggles whether you are taken to the active window when
              selecting a buffer or not.
o             Opens the buffer that is under the cursor into the current
              window.
p             Toggles the showing of a split filename/pathname.
q             Quit exploring.
r             Reverses the order the buffers are listed in.
s             Selects the order the buffers are listed in. Either by buffer
              number, file name, file extension, most recently used (MRU), or
              full path.
u             Toggles the showing of "unlisted" buffers.</literallayout>
<simpara>I don&#8217;t use tabs, in fact I&#8217;d rather stay away from them as much as possible so
that commands relating to those have been omitted.</simpara>
<simpara>I&#8217;m going to have a play around with the other settings to see how useful they
are and go from there.</simpara>
<simpara>The biggest plus for me is the ability to easily delete buffers without having
to remember the buffers number. This alone is a good enough reason to keep it
in my toolchain.</simpara>
<simpara><?asciidoc-pagebreak?></simpara>
</section>
<section id="_nerdtree">
<title>Nerdtree</title>
<simpara>I&#8217;ve touched on Nerdtree in a previous entry, mainly to setup the basics to get me going but I&#8217;ll go over some of the
fundermentals of Nerdtree and why I have decided to go back to using it.</simpara>
<simpara>Though <emphasis>netrw</emphasis> is quite useful I still needed ways of managing files (create, delete, name). This wasn&#8217;t possible with
<emphasis>netrw</emphasis> and though I could map <literal>!rm %</literal> and the other Unix commands, this grows old quick and needs at least 3 mappings
per command. Nerdtree allowed me to do this quite nicely and although I still have <literal>Ctrl-P</literal> to find files I is still
useful to have a file draw to visually display your projects file structure.</simpara>
<simpara>One of the first things I am currently missing is an easy way to open Nerdtree with the current file selected. This
comes in handy when I need to rename or remove a file.</simpara>
<simpara>So to get Nerdtree to open with the current file selected isn&#8217;t hard at all I need to do is bind <literal>:NerdtreeFind</literal> to a
key and I have what I want:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">norenmap &lt;leader&gt;p :NERDTreeFind&lt;CR&gt;</literallayout>
<simpara>I already have a binding on <literal>&lt;leader&gt;p</literal> so I needed to remove that so that they both don&#8217;t collide.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">":map &lt;leader&gt;p :PromoteToLet&lt;cr&gt;</literallayout>
<simpara>I mentioned in <ulink url=":day-19-tweaking-nerdtree.asc">Tweaking Nerdtree</ulink> <literal>&lt;C-p&gt;</literal> is used to toggle Nerdtrees view. Nerdtree
has a host of commands that you can play with, they are easily viewed by pressing <literal>?</literal> within the Nerdtree buffer. I&#8217;ll
simply go over the ones I use the most below:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>p</literal> - jump to the parent directory
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>P</literal> - go to the root directory
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>o</literal> - open and close a directory
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>x</literal> - close and close a directory
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>X</literal> - recursively close and close a directory
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>C</literal> - Make the current directory to the tree root
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>I</literal> - Display hidden files
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>These commands I tend to use the most especially when I need to create and/or manage files:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>m</literal> - show menu
</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>m</literal> - rename node
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>c</literal> - copy node
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>a</literal> - add node
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>A node is basically a file or directory, to specify a directory you simply need to add a forward slash (<emphasis>/</emphasis>).</simpara>
<simpara>Nerdtree support a few other features that I don&#8217;t really use at present, bookmarking directories could be quite useful
but opening files in different tabs isn&#8217;t something I&#8217;m fond off.</simpara>
<note><simpara>I&#8217;m aware that there are commands to CRUD files using <emphasis>netrw</emphasis> but I still am not a fan of the way <literal>:Explore</literal> opens and
keeping track of where it will open can be a pain.</simpara></note>
<simpara><?asciidoc-pagebreak?></simpara>
</section>
<section id="_ctrlp">
<title>CtrlP</title>
<simpara>CtrlP is my "go to" plugin when it comes to being able to open a file quickly without having to type the whole thing
out. I used to use <emphasis>Control-T</emphasis> in the past but that had the extra dependency of needing vim compiled with Ruby support,
though this is not particularly a big deal, <emphasis>Control-T</emphasis> is somewhat slow at time and remembering to compile its binaries
can be a pain. This is where <emphasis>CtrlP</emphasis> takes the lead.</simpara>
<simpara>I&#8217;ve never really spent much time seeing what other features <emphasis>CtrlP</emphasis> has that I am not aware of. The main thing I never
really took advantage of or bothered really to look more into is the ability to search by buffer or MRU (most recently
used) files. I could also bind <literal>::CtrlPBuffer</literal> and <literal>:CtrlPMRU</literal> for when I want to be more specific. For the moment I
will hold out on this and make use of <literal>&lt;C-f&gt;</literal> and <literal>&lt;C-b&gt;</literal> to navigate back and forth between search modes.</simpara>
<simpara>There is a regexp feature that I have never used (<literal>&lt;C-r&gt;</literal>) I should experiement with this a little to find out what it
is actually capable of for the moment it is enough to make use of searching dependent of search type.</simpara>
<simpara>There is also a nice navigation command to allow me to move up a directory <literal>..&lt;CR&gt;</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>I like to have <emphasis>CtrlP</emphasis> search for files in my current project, in which case the setting below does just that. Well that
a bit of a lie, it starts searchs from the directory that contains SCM content. In my case as all my project use git or
another SCM so I know what the root directory is.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">let g:ctrlp_working_path_mode = r                               "Set to a directory that contains .git</literallayout>
<simpara>I also have <emphasis>CtrlP</emphasis> default overiden so that I can use <literal>&lt;C-P&gt;</literal> for something else. In this case I changed it to the
following:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">let g:ctrlp_map = '&lt;unique&gt; &lt;silent&gt; &lt;Leader&gt;&lt;Leader&gt;'</literallayout>
<simpara>Finally to clear <emphasis>CtrlP</emphasis> cache I use the following mapping:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">nnoremap &lt;unique&gt; &lt;silent&gt; &lt;Leader&gt;&lt;Leader&gt;&lt;Leader&gt; :CtrlPClearAllCaches&lt;CR&gt;:CtrlP&lt;CR&gt;"</literallayout>
<simpara>With that I have my file navigation settings pretty much covered for now.</simpara>

<note><simpara>Add a screenshot of the colour scheme</simpara></note>
<simpara>I&#8217;d also like to have some kind of colour scheme management tool to make it easier to separate colorschemes and maintaim
them. What would be cool would be if there was a plugin that allowed me to sample a range of colorschemes and settle on
a given range, similar to the way colour schemes are managed in oh-my-zsh.</simpara>
<simpara>This will be something that I deal with once I have gone over the plugins I currently have.</simpara>

<sidebar>
<literallayout class="monospaced">plugin: vim-surround
homepage: http://github.com/tpope/vim-surround
source: git://github.com/tpope/vim-surround.git</literallayout>
</sidebar>
<simpara>This is plugin is probably one of the most used by myself when writing. It basically allow use to add and remove a tag
text. This is especially useful when working with (X|HT)ML as it requires us to wrap content with in elements, which can
become tedious at the best of times.</simpara>
<simpara>The mappings for manipulating content comes in the following prefixes:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
cs - Change Surrounding tag
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
ds - Delete Surrounding tag
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
ys - Your Surrounding tag
</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
takes a tag and replacing tag
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>I tend to use the first two the most but I&#8217;d like to learn more about what the other really have to offer instead of
sticking to what I already know. This plugin is quite extensive so I&#8217;ll spend more time on getting to grips with the
mappings that I have not used often.</simpara>
<simpara>There are a couple of cool things I can do with these mappings one of the main ones is being able to add tags to
multiple lines at once. One prime example of where this comes in handy is when we want to create a list of HTML
elements. First we&#8217;d get a list of something.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">Rice
Beans
Chocolate</literallayout>
<simpara>Then we&#8217;d type the following:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">ggVG
'&lt;,'&gt;normal yss&lt;li&gt;
ggVGS&lt;ul&gt;</literallayout>
<simpara>Which gives us the output below:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Beans&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chocolate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</literallayout>
<simpara>So what if I want to have the original list back, the standard way of doing this would be to type u a few times. That&#8217;s
boring, surround can help us here to with a couple of commands:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">ggVG
'&lt;,'&gt;normal dst</literallayout>
<simpara>We end up with the content pretty much back to normal:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">Rice
Beans
Chocolate</literallayout>

</sidebar>
<simpara>Ack is probably one of my most used linux commands so it goes without
saying that I&#8217;d like the same functionality for finding string within
Vim the same way.</simpara>
<simpara>It depends on <emphasis>ack</emphasis> so that needed to be installed so that I could take
advantage of the plugin. Thankfully I had that already installed but for
reference this is how I installed it on my box</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">brew install ack</literallayout>
<simpara>To run <emphasis>ack</emphasis> I just need to type the following:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">:Ack --type=ruby 'content to find' path/to/find/content/</literallayout>
<simpara>This will search for <emphasis>content to find</emphasis> within any <emphasis>ruby</emphasis> file within the
<emphasis>path/to/find/content</emphasis> directory. There is an extensive list of file
types <emphasis>ack</emphasis> supports which can be found at <emphasis>ack --help-types</emphasis>. It is
also possible to omit file types also as follows:</simpara>

homwpage: http://github.com/tpope/vim-abolish
source:   git://github.com/tpope/vim-abolish</literallayout>
</sidebar>
<simpara>Abolish is an interesting plugin created by Time Pope, it is essentially 3 plugins wrapped up into 1 (abbreviation,
substitution, coercion).</simpara>
<simpara>We all have problems with our fingers not listening to our brains.  Abbreviation helps us map our common typing mistakes
with what we actually wanted to type. For example I recently had problems type <emphasis>editions</emphasis> and ended up typing <emphasis>edtions</emphasis>
instead.</simpara>
<simpara>Stolen from the plugins homepage, the syntax to invoke abbreviation is as follows:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">Abolish {despa,sepe}rat{e,es,ed,ing,ely,ion,ions,or}       {despe,sepa}rat{}</literallayout>
<simpara>The documentation suggests that I add my abbreviations to <emphasis>~/.vim/after/plugin/abolish.vim</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>Appending a <emphasis>!</emphasis> to the command and the abbreviation will be added to <emphasis>~/.vim/after/plugin/abolish.vim</emphasis>.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">Abolish! edtion{,s} edition</literallayout>
<simpara>Abbreviations can also be removed by adding the <emphasis>--delete</emphasis> flag as follows:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">Abolish -delete edtion{,s}</literallayout>
<simpara>We can also search for variants as well as accomplishing complete, this is means we can find a string regardless of its
case and variant which can be quite helpful.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">:Abolish -search edit{s,ion}
:S edit{s,ion}</literallayout>
<simpara>Which searches for:
  edit
  edition
  editions</simpara>
<note><simpara>This didn&#8217;t work for me at the time of writing this. Should find out why.</simpara></note>
<simpara>The next part of the plugin is substitution. There are occasions when we need to search and replace a variant of a word
whilst still keeping its case and variation. This could be done via a bundle of substitution commands but this can be
error prone and lead to missed changes which can be tedious.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">:%S/edit{ion,s}/edit/g</literallayout>
<simpara>Which will change both <emphasis>edits</emphasis> and <emphasis>edition</emphasis> to <emphasis>edit</emphasis>.</simpara>
<simpara>Finally there is the CoeRse command. The command is very useful when it comes to coding and when you want to change a
variable names format from one to another. For example when you have the variable <emphasis>FilePath</emphasis> which you want to change to
<emphasis>file_path</emphasis>. You simply type <literal>crs</literal> and the variable is now converted to snakecase.</simpara>
<simpara>To coerce a variable into another format you simply start off with the <emphasis>cr</emphasis> and append one of the below keys to change
the variables case.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">c: camelCase
m: MixedCase
_: snake_case
s: snake_case
u: SNAKE_UPPERCASE
-: dash-case (not reversible)</literallayout>

</sidebar>
<simpara>So I like to have shortcuts for commonly typed words and command, especially when I am coding, for this omnicomplete is
cool to an extent but it doesn&#8217;t quite cover exactly what I am looking for. This is where <emphasis>snipmate</emphasis> comes into play. It
allows you to create and use custom keys accompanied by <literal>&lt;TAB&gt;</literal> to quickly type a string. In the past snipmate came with
a host of snippets as part of the plugin but as time has gone on it has dropped them as the list of snippets is quite
exhaustive. They now belong as part of <emphasis>snipmate-snippets</emphasis>.</simpara>
<simpara>I&#8217;m also not a fan of having bloated customisations and have decided to fork <emphasis>snipmate-snippets</emphasis> so that I can tweak it
to my needs. For the time being it is enough to be aware of this and once I stripped down my config, I will put a little
time aside for stripping down customising my snippets.</simpara>

<title>Day 30</title>
<simpara>Today I&#8217;ll be having a look at some text object orientated plugins. As I&#8217;ve mentioned before I quite enjoy text objects
and feel I need to play around with these more.</simpara>

<simpara>So if you didn&#8217;t know before, I&#8217;m quite a fan of text objects and this is one of those plugins that I have been meaning
to wrap my muscle memory around for a long while.</simpara>
<simpara>So the ideal of text objects is that you are able to select a grouping of text easily whilst doing something with it.
The atypical thing to do is the following:</simpara>
<simpara>The first puts me in visual mode and highlights everything inside the block
  vir</simpara>
<simpara>This does similar to the above but highlights all of the block
  var</simpara>
<simpara>It doesn&#8217;t stop there anything that you can do with a single character, you can do with this and other text objects.
Want to delete everything within a block <literal>dir</literal> deletes the inner ruby block.</simpara>
<simpara>The goal for me over the next few days is to play around with these combinations and see what I learn.</simpara>
<note><simpara>Once I&#8217;ve gone over my plugin list I&#8217;ll write more about text objects and what they can do.</simpara></note>

homepage: http://github.com/michaeljsmith/vim-indent-object

<simpara>This plugins add a few more text objects to my tool chain. This one is more general than the last and deals with
indentation blocks of text.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">ai - an indentation level and line above
ii - inner indentation
aI - an indentation level lines below and above</literallayout>
<simpara>As noted in the documentation <literal>iI</literal> is also available but it is essentially added for completeness. As with other text
objects I&#8217;m able to do something with a indent block.</simpara>
<simpara>So to delete a everthing within a indentation text object is done as follows:
  dai</simpara>
<note><simpara>The following will only work with my custom surround bindings.</simpara></note>
<simpara>Selecting an indentation text object and move it up three times.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">vai&lt;C-k&gt;&lt;C-k&gt;&lt;C-k&gt;</literallayout>
<simpara>and moving it down can be do as so:</simpara>

homepage:   http://github.com/claco/jasmine.vim
source:     git://gitHub.com/claco/jasmine.vim.git</literallayout>
<simpara>I like to test what I&#8217;m coding and javascript is no exception, the best unit test tool I&#8217;ve used so far is <emphasis>Jasmine</emphasis>. I
prefer this as it is not that far removed from <emphasis>rspec</emphasis> and it allows me to cleanly write tests whilst driving out
implementation code. I&#8217;ve been using jasmine.vim to help tweak vim to support the framework and provide me with some
useful snippets so that I don&#8217;t have to type too much. It also has the added feature of allowing you to run specs from
within vim, which I am used to doiing for my specs and scenarios. Another benefit of this plugin is it provides
boilerplates for generating new jasmine files, which again saves me from having to repeat myself constantly.</simpara>
<simpara>There are a couple of things I&#8217;d like to do to keep things centralised. Firstly move the snippets into my custom
snippets repository. Keeping all my snippets in one place is going to save me hunting them down later which I&#8217;d rather
not do. I&#8217;d also like to move the templates into a centralised place so that I can build up some boilerplates for other
bits that I work on (rspec, controllers, models, etc).</simpara>
<simpara>The plugin also support syntax highlighting which is always quite useful. For the time being I&#8217;ll gloss over the
snippets bundled in this plugin and go over them once I have them centralised.</simpara>
<simpara><?asciidoc-pagebreak?></simpara>
</section>
<section id="_vim_coffee_script">
<title>vim-coffee-script</title>
<simpara>This is another plugin centered around my frontend activities and bring coffeescript support into my <emphasis>vim</emphasis>. The added
bonus of this plugin is that not only does it have syntax highlighting but it also allows you to compile coffeescript
into Javascript straight from <emphasis>vim</emphasis>.</simpara>
<simpara>To compile coffeescript you run the following command:
  :CoffeeMake</simpara>
<simpara>Output can also be hidden using the following alternative:
  :silent CoffeeMake</simpara>
<simpara>I can also set coffeescript files to compile automatically with the following setting in my vimrc:
  au BufWritePost *.coffee silent CoffeeMake!</simpara>
<note><simpara>When compiling coffeescript I&#8217;ll need to set the path to coffee so that the plugin knows where to find it.</simpara></note>
<simpara>I&#8217;ll refrain from doing this at the moment as I tend to use coffeescript with Rails, which deals with compiling
coffeescript within the asset pipeline, but it is a useful thing to note down and I&#8217;m sure once I get to the point of
defining different vim workflows I&#8217;ll be able to conditionally set this for pure JS projects that I work on in the
future.</simpara>
<simpara>The is also the ability to compile sections of coffeescript which seems interesting. Similarly to specifying a range in
other command you simply prefix the range you want to specify with the compile command:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">3,5 CoffeeCompile</literallayout>
<simpara>There is also the ability to run coffeelint on a file to sanity check it, which is also very nice. The one thing I hate
is watching everything compile and pass yet to find that lint doesn&#8217;t like what I&#8217;ve done.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">:CoffeeLint</literallayout>
<simpara>I&#8217;ll need to add coffeelint to my toolchain and tell the plugin where to find it by supplying the following command in
my vimrc:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">let coffee_linter = '/usr/bin/coffeelint'</literallayout>
<simpara>Finally I can run coffeescript directly within vim with the following:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">:CoffeeRun</literallayout>
<simpara>This will open up another buffer with the scripts output in it.</simpara>

<simpara>I tend to use this when a block is more than 1 line or when it ends up being more than a 1 liner. I also use it when in

<simpara>This plugin adds quite a bit of Ruby related functionality to vim to make it more pleasant to work with the language and
make it easier to move around a file.</simpara>
<section id="_completion">
<title>completion</title>
<simpara>This relies on vim being compiled with ruby. I haven&#8217;t tested it without ruby compiled but I&#8217;d like to think that this
functionality will silently fail if vim is not installed with it enabled.</simpara>
<simpara>When it is enabled it adds extra functionality to omnicomplete so that I am able to search for content that relates
particularly to Ruby. This would include the following:</simpara>
<simpara>Classes, constants and global - When not inside a class definition
Methods, constants defined in the given class - When inside a class definition
Methods relating to the object being deferenced - After <emphasis>.</emphasis>, <emphasis>::</emphasis> or <emphasis>:</emphasis>
Symbol names - After <emphasis>:</emphasis> or <emphasis>:foo</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>It should also be noted that this functionality may slow things down as code may have to be run to disclose class,
method and variable names from inside a ruby file.</simpara>
<note><simpara>There a side cases that should be documented (<ulink url="http://github.com/vim-ruby/vim-ruby/blob/master/doc/ft-ruby-omni.txt">http://github.com/vim-ruby/vim-ruby/blob/master/doc/ft-ruby-omni.txt</ulink>)</simpara></note>

<simpara>Just like the other syntax files vim uses, this mainly deals with syntax highlighting and helping to visualise code when
an rb file is opened. It also helps towards displaying syntax errors that may have been missed. This functionality is
only triggered when a file is saved but I save enough for this not to be an issue.</simpara>
<simpara>There is also the ability to display extra spaces and tabs, of which I have a pet peave, this can be easily set within
my vimrc and will display the spaces or tabs with a background of red. This like other parts of vim can be customised

<simpara>This plugin adds quite a bit of Ruby related functionality to vim to make it more pleasant to work with the language and
make it easier to move around a file.</simpara>
<section id="_completion_2">
<title>completion</title>
<simpara>This relies on vim being compiled with ruby. I haven&#8217;t tested it without ruby compiled but I&#8217;d like to think that this
functionality will silently fail if vim is not installed with it enabled.</simpara>
<simpara>When it is enabled it adds extra functionality to omnicomplete so that I am able to search for content that relates
particularly to Ruby. This would include the following:</simpara>
<simpara>Classes, constants and global - When not inside a class definition
Methods, constants defined in the given class - When inside a class definition
Methods relating to the object being deferenced - After <emphasis>.</emphasis>, <emphasis>::</emphasis> or <emphasis>:</emphasis>
Symbol names - After <emphasis>:</emphasis> or <emphasis>:foo</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>It should also be noted that this functionality may slow things down as code may have to be run to disclose class,
method and variable names from inside a ruby file.</simpara>
<note><simpara>There a side cases that should be documented (<ulink url="http://github.com/vim-ruby/vim-ruby/blob/master/doc/ft-ruby-omni.txt">http://github.com/vim-ruby/vim-ruby/blob/master/doc/ft-ruby-omni.txt</ulink>)</simpara></note>

<section id="_syntax_2">
<title>syntax</title>
<simpara>Just like the other syntax files vim uses, this mainly deals with syntax highlighting and helping to visualise code when
an rb file is opened. It also helps towards displaying syntax errors that may have been missed. This functionality is
only triggered when a file is saved but I save enough for this not to be an issue.</simpara>
<simpara>There is also the ability to display extra spaces and tabs, of which I have a pet peave, this can be easily set within
my vimrc and will display the spaces or tabs with a background of red. This like other parts of vim can be customised
but I&#8217;ll leave that task for another day.</simpara>

<simpara>As with all the other content related plugins <literal>vim-cucumber</literal> adds syntax highlighting, mappings and file recognition. It
also lets you know whether their are syntax errors or a step has not been defined. The former is quite useful as it
keeps you focused and allows you to easily work out which steps need to be implemented and which ones have already been
added. As soon as a feature file is saved compilation is started and shortly after, if there are any errors, you will be
alerted via the quick tip buffer.</simpara>

<simpara>The generic tmux status bar is ok but I prefer a little bit more control and flexibility as to what is shown there and

<title>Installing</title>
<simpara>Initially I just threw everything together and dumped tmux-powerline and the solarized theme into my home directory. I
don&#8217;t particularly like this and create a tmux repository.</simpara>
<simpara>So firstly I&#8217;ve had to fork my own version of <literal>tmux-powerline</literal> mainly so that I could quickly customise my own status
bar but also to that I can add some extra functionality to the tool later on down the road when I get some playtime.</simpara>
<simpara>I&#8217;ll be creating a new directory called <literal>tmux</literal> which will store all my tmux customisations. That include the tmux
solarized theme and my tmux configuration file. I&#8217;ll then symlink <literal>.tmux.conf</literal> to my new repository.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git init
git submodule add git@github.com:baphled/tmux-powerline.git powerline
mv ~/.tmux.conf tmux.conf
ln -s tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf</literallayout>
</section>
<section id="_customisation">
<title>Customisation</title>
<simpara>The main changes needed where to disable the right status bar fully so my panel list can live there and to include and
customise the left bar, where I&#8217;d like most of my information to be stored.</simpara>
<simpara>I made a quite a few tweaks to my tmux conf file which you can see
<ulink url="http://github.com/baphled/tmuxfiles/blob/c933919bb3c2cc4eb904c7d101524cacdeff2ee7/tmux.conf">here</ulink>.</simpara>
<simpara>I don&#8217;t really want to use the right side status bar at the moment, though this may change at some point down the road.
So I want to make sure that the right side status bar doesn&#8217;t display, I do this by making the status empty.</simpara>
<simpara>The one things that annoys me about the current state of <literal>tmux-powerline</literal> is that the status bars generally need to be
customised but there is no real way of doing this at the moment without having to fork the project and make it my own.
This is cool and everything but keeping things up to date can become a pain.</simpara>
<simpara>So in this case I&#8217;m going create my own status file, basically copying my current left statusbar and move it to my
repository.</simpara>

<simpara>The first two parts of my customised status bar are actually done by hand, though it was a cool things to work out at
the time I should create what <literal>tmux-powerline</literal> calls segments. There is already one to display the session name and pane
number but I want to customise it to look like how I currently have it.</simpara>
<simpara>As I already have a forked version of the repository it is easy enough to make this change and remove prerolled version.
Before I do that though I should add a segment for displaying my current username.</simpara>
<simpara>Now I have powerline setup for both tmux and vim :)</simpara>

<title>Day 37</title>
<simpara>I&#8217;ve played around with a few color setting over the past few months but solarized has to be the best so far. Today
I&#8217;ll be setting it up in iTerm2, tmux and vim.</simpara>

<title>Setting up Solarize on my Mac</title>
<simpara>So I&#8217;ve been using the same colour scheme for a while and it&#8217;s and and all but Solarized seems to be the best,
visually, so I&#8217;ve decided to set up Solarized as my main color scheme.</simpara>
<simpara>I&#8217;ll start this off will setting up my Mac. The settings may be slightly different for *nix based machines but I&#8217;ll
tackle that in another entry.</simpara>
<simpara>TODO: Add reference to previous image</simpara>
<simpara>For now I&#8217;ll start with Iterm2. My colour settings are quite basic as you can see from the previous image.</simpara>
<simpara>So first off I needed download the iterm solarized color settings and store them in my dotfiles. I stored the settings
in <literal>~/colors/iterm2/solarized_dark.itermcolors</literal></simpara>

<simpara>The next step is get my Vim setup with Solarized also.</simpara>
<simpara>This was pretty straight forward. I simply had to add the vim-solarized plugin into my dotvim files (add link to
change here).</simpara>

was setup. :)</simpara>

<simpara>There was one thing was I couldn&#8217;t do without, and that was my column width colour. I found a code snippet that fitted
the purpose so I add that to my <literal>~/.vimrc</literal> file.</simpara>

<simpara>Now it&#8217;s time to get tmux setup with Solarized Dark also. I already had a bunch of custom color settings but I&#8217;ve
decided to do away with those and primarily use Solarized. First off I removed the existing colour settings and
downloaded the tmux colour scheme from <ulink url="https://raw.github.com/seebi/tmux-colors-solarized/master/tmuxcolors-dark.conf">https://raw.github.com/seebi/tmux-colors-solarized/master/tmuxcolors-dark.conf</ulink>.</simpara>
<simpara>TODO: Display snippet of the change.</simpara>
<simpara>This was then copied to my tmuxfiles repositories and linked to from with my tmux.conf file.</simpara>
<simpara>Once that was done I simple ran the following command to update my current session.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>source ~/.tmux.conf</literal></simpara>
<simpara>Now that everything is setup. My setup now looks like this:</simpara>

keep my colour settings in. I then linked the desired colour scheme for dircolors <literal>ln -s

<simpara>I also had to install coreutils to get access to the dircolours command.</simpara>

<simpara>I&#8217;ve setup w3m but I haven&#8217;t really had time to experiment with it. I know it can open images and it can apparently open
tabs but I have never played with the former. It would be cool to work out how this happens so I can tell tmux to open a
new tab with a link when ever I feel. This way if I have a link copied and can quickly trigger a tmux mapping and get it

<simpara>I have IRC setup but I still need to tweak it somewhat so that I can use it more as I used to. One of the primary uses
of IRC for me is using XDCC. On my old windows machine I used to have a script that allowed me to gather a list of
interesting files to download and queue them up accordingly. It allowed me to only download a certain amount of files at
a time and move them to a completed directory once each one had finished downloading. I&#8217;d like to replicate this in
irssi so that I don&#8217;t have to spend time finding content of interest and simply choose what I want and forget about it.</simpara>

GUI tools. Today and tomorrow will be focused on getting to know these tool better and spending some time getting the to
work just as I would like to use them.</simpara>
<simpara>bjurl should be easy to tweak, I want to be able to keep track of as many URL&#8217;s as possible without having to reset it

<simpara>Having the Control key where it is as default can be quite a strain on
the fingers and I very rarely use the CAPLOCK key. So it&#8217;s a good idea

<simpara>This is pretty easy to do on a mac. I needed to go to System settings

<title>Remapping my fingers</title>
<simpara>One of the most interesting things I have picked up whilst getting back to a
console centric workflow is that a lot depends on where my fingers sit on the
keyboard. Over time I learnt to touch type in my own way and after a time I
still find myself looking at the keyboard to find a random key or having to
stretch my fingers more than a typical toucher typer would.</simpara>
<simpara>I see the value in typing in traditional way but I never got round to leanring
properly as I&#8217;ve had "othering" to do.</simpara>
<simpara>[NOTE]: Need a way of actually relearning where my fingers should be.</simpara>
<simpara>I maywell try to attempt this gradually and intergrate it into my daily
entries. It&#8217;s going to take some dicipline but I think it shouldn&#8217;t take much
effort to remap my fingers to centre around the homekeys more naturally.</simpara>

<title>Procmail recipe workflow</title>
<simpara>Getting recipes just right can be interesting and in the past I
literally had to play it by ear. On this time round I wanted to be a bit
more smarter about it. I had a little search online and came up with
<ulink url="http://pm-doc.sourceforge.net/doc/#what_is_dry_run_testing">this</ulink> which
helped quite a lot. It gave my inspiration to refine this into a
workflow so that I could easily test recipes whilst not having to wait
for an email to actually come through.</simpara>
<note><simpara>Add link to <literal>~/bin/procmail_recipe_test</literal>. Located at GH#e452d09</simpara></note>
<simpara>I wrapped the Procmail dryrun command as shown above to easily run the
script.</simpara>
<simpara>Procmail logs are located at <literal>~/logs/procmail-dryrun.log</literal> so I ran <literal>tail
-f ~/logs/procmail.log</literal> in a split pane so that I could see what was
coming in.</simpara>
<note><simpara>Ideally this should be part of the script that I just built.</simpara></note>
<simpara>Doing this gave me that ability to see how a the sample email was being
filter, if at all.</simpara>
<simpara>Now the last peice of the puzzle was to easily create test emails
without having to do them by hand. This again was pretty simple as mutt
was already setup to use vim as its editor.</simpara>
<simpara>Pressing <literal>e</literal> in mutt opened an email in vim which meant that in Normal

<section id="_vim_navigation_workflow">
<title>VIM navigation workflow</title>
<simpara>I&#8217;d like to take this opportunity to take note of my current navigation workflow in VIM. I use both NerdTree and CtrlP
to navigate files in a project. As there are times when I know exactly what a file is called and/or how to get to it
there is <emphasis>CtrlP</emphasis> quick and easy to open a file without having to really think about it. Then there are the time when I
just want to get a lay of the land or a file is not where I expect it to be, this typically happens when a files naming
convention breaks some of my vim plugins.</simpara>
<simpara><?asciidoc-pagebreak?></simpara>
</section>
<section id="_existing_projects">
<title>Existing projects</title>
<simpara>I&#8217;m often cloning a range of projects and have a few recipes that I use to set
these up. To help me improve this workflow and finally automate I will outline
the process and get it automated.</simpara>
<simpara>I typically have a number of windows open that I use to get my work done. First and foremost I always have <emphasis>vim</emphasis> open
and typically set to the first window. I then have a browser open to the given languages API, this is usually via a
browser.</simpara>
<simpara>If the given language has a REPL then I&#8217;ll have this open in another window for
me to easily play around with concepts whilst ironing out a solution.</simpara>
<simpara>I&#8217;ll start off with the most used, which would be rails and ruby projects. I&#8217;ll
create base configs for theses workflows and then create a wrapper script that
allows me to clone a project and then copy the config to the correct place and
finally start the session by call tmuxinator.</simpara>
<simpara><?asciidoc-pagebreak?></simpara>
</section>
<section id="_ruby_projects">
<title>Ruby projects</title>
<simpara>So the first project workflow i&#8217;ll capture is ruby projects there are a couple
of ingredients to this recipe which go as follows:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
vim
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
pry running the applications environemnt
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
the version of ruby
</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">project_name: PROJECT_NAME
project_root: PROJECT_PATH
rvm: RUBY_VERSION@PROJECT_NAME
pre: cd PROJECT_PATH &amp;&amp; bundle &amp;&amp; gup
tabs:
  - Workbench:
      layout: b147,208x73,0,0[208x62,0,0,208x10,0,63{104x10,0,63,103x10,105,63}]
      panes:
        - vim
        - #empty, will just run plain zsh
  - Server: rackup
  - "Ruby Docs": w3m http://http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-RUBY_VERSION/
  - Spyhole: tail -f ~/workbench.log
  - "Project Summary": g wtf
  - Toybox: pry</literallayout>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<note><simpara>Add a basic breakdown of what the config file actually does.</simpara></note>
<simpara>So I&#8217;ll need a script that takes the following arguements:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
project name
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
project path
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
ruby version
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The first thing to do is create a new directory, this will be where all my tmux
workflow templates will be stored. I then copied the above code into a file
called <emphasis>ruby-project.yml</emphasis> which will be used to create my ruby based sesssion.</simpara>
<simpara>I then hacked together a script called <emphasis>setup_project</emphasis> as a ruby script to
basically do all the leg work for me.</simpara>
<simpara>The script basically takes a git repo and clones the repository. It then try to
work out what version of ruby is needed and creates a new gemset. Once this is
complete I manipulate the skeletion yaml file and copies it into my tmuxinator
directory. Now I&#8217;m ready to call the session and get to working.</simpara>
<simpara>The complete script can be found here, it basically does what I outlined above
and will be the basis of the other workflows that I decide to focus on.</simpara>
<simpara>The only I came across was the an issue with not being able to load pry with a
projects config. I&#8217;ll look into this as a side issue and create a new issue to
address the changes.</simpara>
<simpara>Next, I&#8217;ll do the same for rails projects.</simpara>

<simpara>Initially I only want it to make a few changes, as outlined earlier, then once
it is working for the basic workflows I&#8217;ll gradually improve the script to

<title>Updating my old machine with my new dotfiles</title>
<simpara>So today is a little bit of a detour but I wanted to get this down for getting
my other machines to make use of my new settings.</simpara>
<simpara>Firstly I tried to do a simple update but because of the change from <emphasis>braid</emphasis> to
<emphasis>git submodule</emphasis> that wasn&#8217;t possible. So the alternative was to remove my old
settings and <literal>.git/config</literal>.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">rm -rf .git dotvim oh-my-zsh .gitconfig .gitignore</literallayout>
<simpara>That removed all the files that related to my custom setings and allowed me to
start a fresh pretty quickly. As there is no way to clone my dotfiles directly.
I had to take the follwoing steps.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git init
git add remote origin git@github.com/baphled/dotfiles.git
git pull origin master</literallayout>
<simpara>Once this was complete I still had to get the submodules updated so that everything was nicely setup.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git submodule update --init</literallayout>
<simpara>Now I&#8217;m sure that there is a better way of doing this but as my dotvim
repository also has submodules I need to run the same command as above within
that directory to make sure that everything was up to date.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">cd ~/dotvim
git submodule update --init</literallayout>
<simpara>Once that was updated everything was ready to use.</simpara>

<title>Dotfiles with some Raspbian Pi</title>
<simpara>Today I had to install my dotfiles on a new system. These are the steps I needed to take.</simpara>
<simpara>Firstly I had to remove <literal>.bashrc</literal> as I already have a copy in my dotfiles. I did this with the following command.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">rm .bashrc</literallayout>
<simpara>Once that was complete I had to run the following commands to pull down my dotfiles and get the updated locally.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">git init
git add remote origin git://github.com/baphled/dotfiles.git
git pull &amp;&amp; git submodule init &amp;&amp; git submodule update &amp;&amp; git submodule status
git submodule foreach --recursive git submodule update --init</literallayout>
<note><simpara>I&#8217;m sure there is a cleaner way to do this but it seems to do the trick for now.</simpara></note>
<simpara>As Raspbian doesn&#8217;t have zsh install by default I had to install it my self.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">sudo apt-get install zsh</literallayout>
<simpara>As my dotfiles require <literal>rvm</literal> to display the gemset I am currently working in.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby</literallayout>
<simpara>Once the installation process completed rvm was install and I was free to set zsh as my default shell.</simpara>
<simpara>The final step is to update my shell to zsh instead of bash.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">chsh -s /bin/zsh</literallayout>
<simpara>This will prompt for a password and once authorised the change will become perminent.</simpara>

<simpara>solution: Make sure you use the closing tag, this way there will not be a space between the special characters and the
inner text.</simpara>
<simpara>problem: Display line width solution: Add the following to your vimrc:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">set colorcolumn=140
set tw=140</literallayout>
<simpara>This sets the linecount to 140 and displays a vertical line where the line limit is.</simpara>
