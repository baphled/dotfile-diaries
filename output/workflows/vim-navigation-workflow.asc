==== VIM navigation workflow

I'd like to take this opportunity to take note of my current navigation workflow in VIM. I use both NerdTree and CtrlP
to navigate files in a project. As there are times when I know exactly what a file is called and/or how to get to it
there is 'CtrlP' quick and easy to open a file without having to really think about it. Then there are the time when I
just want to get a lay of the land or a file is not where I expect it to be, this typically happens when a files naming
convention breaks some of my vim plugins.
