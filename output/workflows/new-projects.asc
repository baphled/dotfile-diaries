=== Existing projects

I'm often cloning a range of projects and have a few recipes that I use to set
these up. To help me improve this workflow and finally automate I will outline
the process and get it automated.

I typically have a number of windows open that I use to get my work done. First
and foremost I always have 'vim' open and typically set to the first window. I
then have a browser open to the given languages API, this is usually via a
browser.

If the given language has a REPL then I'll have this open in another window for
me to easily play around with concepts whilst ironing out a solution.

I'll start off with the most used, which would be rails and ruby projects. I'll
create base configs for theses workflows and then create a wrapper script that
allows me to clone a project and then copy the config to the correct place and
finally start the session by call tmuxinator.
