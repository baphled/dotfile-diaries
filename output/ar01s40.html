improve the way we solve and look at problems.</p><p>One of the best ways to do this is to actively learn something new every day.</p><p>For us, we’ll learn a new Vim trick and learn more about the linux tools that
we have available to us and which can help improve the way we do our work day

this interesting. We’ll create a simple script that will bring up a random man

these for our day to day work.</p><p>Some utils we should look at:

  ack

literally had to play it by ear. On this time round I wanted to be a bit
more smarter about it. I had a little search online and came up with
<a class="ulink" href="http://pm-doc.sourceforge.net/doc/#what_is_dry_run_testing" target="_top">this</a> which
helped quite a lot. It gave my inspiration to refine this into a
workflow so that I could easily test recipes whilst not having to wait
for an email to actually come through.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Add link to <code class="literal">~/bin/procmail_recipe_test</code>. Located at GH#e452d09</p></div><p>I wrapped the Procmail dryrun command as shown above to easily run the
script.</p><p>Procmail logs are located at <code class="literal">~/logs/procmail-dryrun.log</code> so I ran <code class="literal">tail
-f ~/logs/procmail.log</code> in a split pane so that I could see what was
coming in.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Ideally this should be part of the script that I just built.</p></div><p>Doing this gave me that ability to see how a the sample email was being
filter, if at all.</p><p>Now the last peice of the puzzle was to easily create test emails
without having to do them by hand. This again was pretty simple as mutt
was already setup to use vim as its editor.</p><p>Pressing <code class="literal">e</code> in mutt opened an email in vim which meant that in Normal
mode I was apply to give the following command to save the sample email:</p><pre class="literallayout">:w ~/emailtest.txt</pre><p>Now that the sample email was save I am free to run
<code class="literal">~/bin/procmail_recipe_test</code> and see how the email is processed.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Add screenshot of the split panes to demostrate the workflow</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_remapping_my_fingers"/>Remapping my fingers</h3></div></div></div><p>One of the most interesting things I have picked up whilst getting back to a
console centric workflow is that a lot depends on where my fingers sit on the
keyboard. Over time I learnt to touch type in my own way and after a time I
still find myself looking at the keyboard to find a random key or having to
stretch my fingers more than a typical toucher typer would.</p><p>I see the value in typing in traditional way but I never got round to leanring
properly as I’ve had "othering" to do.</p><p>[NOTE]: Need a way of actually relearning where my fingers should be.</p><p>I maywell try to attempt this gradually and intergrate it into my daily
entries. It’s going to take some dicipline but I think it shouldn’t take much
effort to remap my fingers to centre around the homekeys more naturally.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_nix_stuff"/>*nix Stuff</h3></div></div></div><p>Here is where I’m going store the various titbit that I’ve learnt over the
years. I am assuming by the vagueness of this notion it will start of as a grap
bag of notes and gradually split off to different sections.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
