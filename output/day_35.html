<p>I’ve setup w3m but I haven’t really had time to experiment with it. I know it
can open images and it can apparently open tabs but I have never played with
the former. It would be cool to work out how this happens so I can tell tmux to
open a new tab with a link when ever I feel. This way if I have a link copied
and can quickly trigger a tmux mapping and get it open a new tab in the
<span class="emphasis"><em>Interwepts</em></span> window :)</p>
<p>I have IRC setup but I still need to tweak it somewhat so that I can use it
more as I used to. One of the primary uses of IRC for me is using XDCC. On my
old windows machine I used to have a script that allowed me to gather a list of
interesting files to download and queue them up accordingly. It allowed me to
only download a certain amount of files at a time and move them to a completed
directory once each one had finished downloading. I’d like to replicate this in
irssi so that I don’t have to spend time finding content of interest and simply
choose what I want and forget about it.</p>
<p>I’ve been using bjurl and twirssi for a little bit now but I still don’t know
how to use it as productively as I know my GUI tools. Today and tomorrow will
be focused on getting to know these tool better and spending some time getting
the to work just as I would like to use them.</p>
<p>bjurl should be easy to tweak, I want to be able to keep track of as many URL’s
as possible without having to reset it or be quick enough to select a link to
view. I should simply be able to select one from what I see and not have to
deal with anything else.</p>
