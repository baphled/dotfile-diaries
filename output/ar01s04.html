explanation as to why they are useful and why I can’t live without them.</p></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>One of the things I’d like to focus on here is text manipulation without the use of "Visual mode"

and setup my own Vim rig. I’d like the coming next 6 weeks to focus on storing the grass roots functionality of Vim into
muscle memory. I’ll be referring to <a class="ulink" href="http://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim" target="_top">Practical Vim</a> a lot which has been a
great source of knowledge for me in the past year.</p><p/></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_day_34"/>Day 34</h3></div></div></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Turn this section into a workflow based entry</p></div><p>I used to keep up to date with my daily TV shows via bittorrent of late is has become something of a challenge as I have
had less and less time to actually take the time to keep up to date and track what is currently out.</p><p>I’d like to find a usable bit torrent client that will help me do this and help me to be notified of new TV episodes
coming out.</p><p/></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_day_35"/>Day 35</h3></div></div></div><p>I’ve setup w3m but I haven’t really had time to experiment with it. I know it can open images and it can apparently open
tabs but I have never played with the former. It would be cool to work out how this happens so I can tell tmux to open a
new tab with a link when ever I feel. This way if I have a link copied and can quickly trigger a tmux mapping and get it
open a new tab in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Interwepts</em></span> window :)</p><p>I have IRC setup but I still need to tweak it somewhat so that I can use it more as I used to. One of the primary uses
of IRC for me is using XDCC. On my old windows machine I used to have a script that allowed me to gather a list of
interesting files to download and queue them up accordingly. It allowed me to only download a certain amount of files at
a time and move them to a completed directory once each one had finished downloading. I’d like to replicate this in
irssi so that I don’t have to spend time finding content of interest and simply choose what I want and forget about it.</p><p>I’ve been using bjurl and twirssi for a little bit now but I still don’t know how to use it as productively as I know my
GUI tools. Today and tomorrow will be focused on getting to know these tool better and spending some time getting the to
work just as I would like to use them.</p><p>bjurl should be easy to tweak, I want to be able to keep track of as many URL’s as possible without having to reset it
or be quick enough to select a link to view. I should simply be able to select one from what I see and not have to deal
with anything else.</p><p/></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_day_36"/>Day 36</h3></div></div></div><p>Today is that day I start hacking on some scripts and start to get used to some of the tools I’ve neglected to use over
the years. My main focus will be to improve he way I use sed and awk and improve my bash script so that I can quickly
hack some workflow scripts together to help tweak my productivity further.</p><p/></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_day_37"/>Day 37</h3></div></div></div><p/></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_day_38"/>Day 38</h3></div></div></div><p>Today I’ll work on getting to know twirssi a little bit more. These are the most important things I want to get to know
so that I can become more productive with the tool and be able to track conversations I’ve had and what other people are
