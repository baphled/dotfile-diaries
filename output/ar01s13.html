this setup to be retrieved automatically and work out some procmail recipes so
that I my email is nicely organised for me.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_organising_my_email"/>Organising my email</h3></div></div></div><p>So like most I get quite a lot of email, varying in importance and
relevance dependant on time. I’d like to get my old setup back in place
with a few tweaks. Things are pretty much configured so that my email
will be sent to the correct file but I need to improve on these recipes
so that I don’t have to keep going back and forth over a long period of
time constantly tweaking it.</p><p>There are a few groups I know I’ll need and as time goes by I will have
to add the odd new recipe but for now I’ll focus on my personal email
and how to get that under some order.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Link to my first procmailrc</p></div><p>As with others I get quite a lot from various services, these can be
filtered more as time goes on but for now I’d like a dumping ground
<code class="literal">social</code> which will store all the unmatched emails that may slip through
procmails net.</p><p>I also like to not see email regarding jobs/roles I’m not interested in.
Emails that have a given type of subject or come from know offenders
(crappy recruitment consultants) should be sent to <code class="literal">/dev/null</code> so that I
don’t have to bother with them. This may need some tweaking but I think
testing my recipes by dry running it against my main email address
should help to get this refined relatively quickly</p><p>I also need a new directory to be created for any discussion groups I
have joined. The idea here is that these will be caught by procmail and
the name of the file will be created based on this. This way I don’t
have to meddle with procmailrc too much and keeps things nice a clean.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_mailing_lists"/>Mailing lists</h4></div></div></div><p>First things was to create a dummy email.</p><pre class="literallayout">From info@meetup.com  Wed Jul 18 00:00:20 2012

GoDady use this account a bit so they’ll be the first ones to go. Then
next work would be <span class="emphasis"><em>campaign</em></span> this wreaks of PR type stuff I’m not
