<p>I already have my dotfiles under version control but I would like to clean
these up and find a way to make them a little bit more maintainable. Primarily
I want to move away from using braid and my forked version of my dotfiles.</p>
<p>This will lead me towards improving my vim settings and skills.</p>
<p>For this I will setup my dotfiles from scratch and show the pros and cons of my
setup and how I like to have things laid out.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b></b></p>
<pre class="literallayout">duration: 8 days
notes:
  * start my dotfiles from scratch
  * define local files to hide
  * setup tmux and tmuxinator
  * pull in my versioned settings (oh-my-zsh, dotmutt, dotirssi)</pre>
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a id="_day_8"></a>Day 8</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Today I’d like to start sketching out how my dotfiles should be setup and
maintained. I’ll also come up with some ideas as to what my dotfiles will
include and how to maintain the core dependencies of them.</p>
<p>As some of the setup may change from box to box I shouldn’t have to throw
everything into once basket, my dotfiles, I’d like to build some scripts that
handle the dependencies of the setup and makes it easy for me to continue to
tweak it whilst allowing it to be setup on any box with ease.</p>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a id="_dotfile_blueprints"></a>Dotfile blueprints</h4></div></div></div>
<p>So this is where the plan starts to come together.</p>
<p>My dotfiles should be a collection of settings and utilities that help me with
my day to day work. As time has gone on I’ve learnt what I like and what I
don’t and have always like the idea of having one group setting that can go
anywhere. Back in the day my setup was stored on my personal CVS repository,
these days its github.</p>
<p>NOTE:
This link will need to be changed when we start the new version or clean up the
current.</p>
<p>I already have my dotfiles <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/baphled/dotfiles" target="_top">here</a>.</p>
<p>So there are a few thins I’ll need my dotfiles to have, as follows:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
I must be able to push changes to any of my dotfiles without adding them to
    my actual dotfiles, at present I’m having to do a lot of copy and pasting
</li>
<li>
It must be easy to update dependancies
</li>
<li>
Must be under version control
</li>
<li>
Should have a collection of custom scripts for things I do a lot of
</li>
<li>
This is start off by being a bunch of git scripts
</li>
<li>
Alert me if my dotfiles or their dependancies are out of date
</li>
<li>
I’ll start on doing this just for my other dotfiles (dotmutt, dotirssi, etc)
</li>
<li>
Create a script to install my dependancies
</li>
<li>
This will start of by focussing on installing things via brew
</li>
<li>
Should automatically check for new gems that my dotfiles rely on
</li>
<li>
Must include the applications that my dotfiles rely on
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title">
<a id="_the_basics"></a>The basics</h5></div></div></div>
<p>Let’s start from the top, I want the following:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
Vim
</li>
<li>
Tmux
</li>
<li>
ZSH
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>Regardless of what I’m aiming to do I’ll need all of these to make my workflow
as productive as possible.</p>
<p>I’ll need to branch my current repository so that I can start a fresh, once
this is done, the next thing to do will be to add the dependancies. I may look
into using puppet or chef for this but if that is the case then I will want to
make sure that my dotfiles knows how to do a <code class="literal">bundle install</code>.</p>
<p>So I guess the first thing will be to install rvm and get that setup so I can
setup ruby.</p>
<p>I should also document this process so that I can turn it into a script which
makes sure that I have the correct version of ruby and have run bundle.</p>
<p>So for zsh I’ll want to use <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/baphled/oh-my-zsh" target="_top"> oh-my-zsh </a>. I’ll use my own forked version, which
includes my custom theme, and will add it to my newly created dotfiles.</p>
<p>The main issue at the moment is that if I have made changes to my dotfiles or
any of their sub repositories I’d like the commit to got to the right
repository and not just be added to my dotfiles.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how easy it is to achieve this but this would be the ideal
situation for how I work. It very rare that I know the correct config or
commands or changes for the at matter from the get go and have to spend a
little time tinkering on my local setup before I can commit to anything. So
having to keep track of these changes and copy them to the specific repository
is a pain and error prone.</p>

<p>Today I’ll be looking at what I have at the moment, in terms of my dotfiles
setup, and what I need to deal to improve it and make it easier to maintain.</p>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a id="_starting_a_new"></a>Starting a new</h4></div></div></div>
<p>So the first thing I’ll need to do is stripped down my repository so that
I can start a new.</p>
<p>WARNING:
This can be somewhat hazardious if you rely on having all of your
downloads in your home directory as the following command will remove
everything from your repository and working directory</p>
<p>This will be used to stripped down my dotvim repository and help me
start from scratch whilst keeping my master branch intacted.</p>
<pre class="literallayout">git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/stripped
rm .git/index
git clean -fdx</pre>
<p>This took some time and basically removed everything in my home
directory, which I didn’t really think about prior to running the
command. So going back was not really an option.</p>
<p>Once the command had finished all my personal setting were removed and I
recieved a bunch of errors relating to RVM not being found. This was
because my zsh settings rely on RVM for prompt information.</p>
<p>So the first thing I want to do is change into bash and get RVM back up
and running.</p>
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a id="_installing_rvm"></a>Installing RVM</h4></div></div></div>
<p>So the first thing i’ll need is RVM. This will be needed by my zsh
prompt and for the dependancies for my workflow.</p>
<p>I like to have the latest version of Ruby so I can keep up with what’s
new in the latest releases.</p>
<pre class="literallayout">curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby</pre>
<p>This will install the latest version of RVM and Ruby, so I am well on my
way to getting Ruby setup on my system.</p>
<p>Once rvm and the latest version of Ruby installed I wanted to change my
setup so that the gems installed as part of my dotfiles are now
installed in global, so that they are available everywhere.</p>
<p>To do this I needed to make sure I was in the global gemset which was
done by using the following command.</p>
<pre class="literallayout">rvm gemset use global</pre>
<p>Now that I am using the correct gemset, I need to make sure that I run
bundle to make sure that everything is in place.</p>
<pre class="literallayout">bundle</pre>
<p>Once this is complete I have all my gems and rvm setup and ready to go.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a id="_removing_braid"></a>Removing Braid</h4></div></div></div>
<p>Braid can be a pain and I’d rather have more control over my external
repositories to achieve this I will look into using git submodules. But
first I will need to remove the external repositories and get rid of
braid.</p>
<p>I had the following gems installed before I started this process:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">braid
git-scribe
tmuxinator
pry</pre>
<p>I no longer want to use braid, so I will firstly remove all the external
repositories</p>
<p>I also have the following external repositories:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">oh-my-zsh
dotirssi
muttfiles
dotvim</pre>
<div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Warning</h3>
<p>Removing these files cause a lot of things to break.</p>
</div>
<p>To make sure that I don’t break anything I can’t fix imediately, and to
keep my previous setup, I’ll need to create a new branch</p>
<pre class="literallayout">gco -b remove_braid</pre>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
<p>The above command uses an aliases via oh-my-zsh</p>
</div>
<p>We’ll start off by removing these via braid as follows:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">braid remove oh-my-zsh
braid remove dotirssi
braid remove dotmutt
braid remove dotvim</pre>
<p>So the most important repository for me is oh-my-zsh it’s pretty much
invaluable and it would be an idea to get this setup as soon as possible.</p>
<pre class="literallayout">git submodule add git@github.com:baphled/oh-my-zsh.git oh-my-zsh
git submodule init
git submodule update</pre>
<p>Now I have my zsh setup as a submodule I can make changes to the repository and
push them directory to the right repository :)</p>
<p>The next thing is to do the same for my other repositories</p>
<pre class="literallayout">git submodule add git@github.com:baphled/dotvim.git dotvim
git submodule add git@github.com:baphled/muttfiles.git dotmutt
git submodule add git@github.com:baphled/dotirssi.git dotirssi</pre>
<p>Now any changes made to my external repositories intermally or externally can
now be easily tracked :)</p>
<p>The last step in the journey is to remove braid from my Gemfile as it is no
longer needed directly by the repository. That is as easy as removing the line
<code class="literal">gem "braid"</code> and running <code class="literal">bundle</code> again.</p>
<p>Now we have a cleaner repository and less worry in regards to how my other
repositories are updated and managed.</p>
<p>So now that I am using git’s submodules to manage my external repositories I
can now make local changes and update the correct repository without polutting
my dotfiles with changes that are not directly related to them.</p>

<p>In my old muttrc file I had procmail getting my mails and storing them in
separate folders so that I can work out what was what and how important it was.
I’ve long since had this setup and I’ve pretty much forgotten how it was all
setup.</p>
<p>Today is the day I start getting this setup back, this only be the start I want
to be able to view all my email account via mutt and drop the UI all together.
I look into email filtering and gradually improve my mutt as I go along.</p>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a id="_improving_mutt"></a>Improving mutt</h4></div></div></div>
<p>So I have my GMail account setup but that’s not enough. I want to include all
my personal email accounts and maintain them.</p>
<p>This will include processing my mail and sending/creating subdirectories based
on a single emails content.</p>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title">

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
procmail
</li>
<li>
mutt
</li>
<li>
fetchmail
</li>
<li>
msmtp
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>Procmail and fetchmail are installed on Macs by default so that saves me a
step, so I guess the next things is to create some mail recipes.</p>
<p>So I’ll have to run the following to get the ball rolling:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">brew install msmtp</pre>
<p>I then had to add the following to my <code class="literal">.zshrc</code></p>
<pre class="literallayout">MAIL=/home/baphled/mail/inbox &amp;&amp; export MAIL</pre>
<p>Then  in my home directory I ran:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">touch .fetchmailrc
chmod 700 .fetchmailrc</pre>
<p>I then needed to poll my main email account
  poll mail.my-email-account.net with proto POP3
    user <span class="emphasis"><em>EMAILADDRESS</em></span> keep
    mda <span class="emphasis"><em>/usr/bin/procmail -d %T</em></span></p>
<p>I put my credentials in my <code class="literal">.netrc</code> file as follows:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">machine mail.my-email-accoun.net
login my-username
password my-password</pre>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
<p>Make sure that <code class="literal">.netrc</code> is added to <code class="literal">.gitignore</code></p>
</div>
<p>I had to make sure that I had setup my email details properply and to do this I
had to do the following:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">fetchmail</pre>
<p>Once everything was setup properly fetchmail did it’s things and retrieved my
email. This is the bare minimum I need to make sure that I have procmail
working so that I can store my email in the right directories.</p>
<p>I need to then create the mail directory <code class="literal">~/Mail</code> which is where all my mail
will end up.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title">
<a id="_recipes"></a>Recipes</h5></div></div></div>
<p>So now I need to sort my emails into separate files so that I can deal with
them easily.</p>
<p>For this I’ll be using procmail and its' recipes to determine where emails
should.</p>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
<p>Add my basic recipes here</p>
</div>
<p>I’d also like to make fetchmail get my latest mail via mutt and not via a
background process, this is quite easy with the follwoing macro:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">macro generic G \
  &lt;shell-escape&gt;'fetchmail'&lt;enter&gt; \
  'Run fetchmail'</pre>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
<p>Need to document how to setup mail directories</p>
</div>
<p>Now I need to be able to move around my filtered directories easily. To do this
I can add a couple of macros to allow me to do just this.</p>

<p>So my email is being retrieve, manually, so now I’d like to focus on getting
this setup to be retrieved automatically and work out some procmail recipes so
that I my email is nicely organised for me.</p>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a id="_organising_my_email"></a>Organising my email</h4></div></div></div>
<p>So like most I get quite a lot of email, varying in importance and
relevance dependant on time. I’d like to get my old setup back in place
with a few tweaks. Things are pretty much configured so that my email
will be sent to the correct file but I need to improve on these recipes
so that I don’t have to keep going back and forth over a long period of
time constantly tweaking it.</p>
<p>There are a few groups I know I’ll need and as time goes by I will have
to add the odd new recipe but for now I’ll focus on my personal email
and how to get that under some order.</p>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
<p>Link to my first procmailrc</p>
</div>
<p>As with others I get quite a lot from various services, these can be
filtered more as time goes on but for now I’d like a dumping ground
<code class="literal">social</code> which will store all the unmatched emails that may slip through
procmails net.</p>
<p>I also like to not see email regarding jobs/roles I’m not interested in.
Emails that have a given type of subject or come from know offenders
(crappy recruitment consultants) should be sent to <code class="literal">/dev/null</code> so that I
don’t have to bother with them. This may need some tweaking but I think
testing my recipes by dry running it against my main email address
should help to get this refined relatively quickly</p>
<p>I also need a new directory to be created for any discussion groups I
have joined. The idea here is that these will be caught by procmail and
the name of the file will be created based on this. This way I don’t
have to meddle with procmailrc too much and keeps things nice a clean.</p>

<p>Now the problem here is that mutt does not recognise the directory and I

<p>Basically I echo the matched address out to the shell which then returns
everything but the last column, in this case it’s the email address. It
then removes all spaces and we have our directory.</p>

<p>I’m still getting quite a bit of email dumped into my main inbox. I want

<p>Anything that has <span class="emphasis"><em>offers</em></span> in the email address are the first to go.
GoDady use this account a bit so they’ll be the first ones to go. Then
next work would be <span class="emphasis"><em>campaign</em></span> this wreaks of PR type stuff I’m not
really interested in. Another keyword would be <span class="emphasis"><em>discount</em></span> if you you
have this in your email address I more than like never see your email ;)</p>
<p>It seems that people actually use a <span class="emphasis"><em>marketing</em></span> account so again this
will be put in the same inbox as others above.</p>

<p>So it’s been a while since I’ve rebased my changes to the master branch.
I’m relatively happy with the removal of <span class="emphasis"><em>braid</em></span> so I think it’s time to
merge my latest changes into my master branch.</p>
<p>So the first issue I had was that I had problems checking out the master
branch because of the changes to the external repositiories. So I had to
issue the following command:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">git co -f master</pre>
<p>This allow me to checkout the master branch and disregard the previous
warnings.</p>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
<p>Doing this can be a time soak.</p>
</div>
<p>I could them do the following to merge my braidless branch into master.</p>
<pre class="literallayout">gup braidless</pre>
<p>After this gladly there were no merge conflicts but all of my external
repositiories were deleted.</p>
<p>I basically had to go into each of the external repositiories and
checkout all off the deleted files. This took some time but once it was
comeplete the master branch was happily merged.</p>

<p>There are a couple of small things that need to be adressed before I introduce
my other email accounts. As it stands I have filtered mail but there is no easy
way of getting to my filtered inbox without some hassle. I need to setup a way
to let mutt automatically know which mailboxes I have without having to
constantly update my muttrc file.</p>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a id="_update_mailbox_list"></a>Update mailbox list</h4></div></div></div>
<p>I had problems trying to get mutt to list all my mail boxes internally
due to my bash noobishness but I did find a way to do it
semi-automatically. I’d like to improve on this process so that I can
make it a lot easier to be able to keep my inbox list up to date whilst
keeping mutt open.</p>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title">
<a id="_the_idea"></a>The idea</h5></div></div></div>
<p>So it was pretty easy to create a script that lists all the files in my
mail directory and returns them as a list of arguments. I then loop over
each mailbox and echo out the format needed for mutt to recognise it as
a mailbox.</p>
<p>Once I have the desired string I then send it to a mutt config file in a
format mutt can recognise.</p>
<pre class="literallayout">mailboxes =inbox =foodie =gaming</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title">
<a id="_bringing_it_to_life"></a>Bringing it to life</h5></div></div></div>
<p>This did actually take some time to work out the simplist way of
actually getting a list of mailboxes without having to update my muttrc
everytime one was discovered.</p>
<p>I knew the best way to do this via the command line but I wasn’t
completely sure how. I first start off by getting a list of inboxes and
piping the results to xargs so that I could loop over each of them but
this caused a broken pipe error when ran as a subcommand in my muttrc.
After a while of hacking a few concepts I remember how useful sed is in
these situations. I ended up with the below code snippet which actually
did what I wanted for the time being.</p>
<pre class="literallayout">mailboxes `ls -r ~/Mail | xargs | sed 's/ / =/g' | sed 's/inbox/=inbox/'`</pre>
<p><b>Hack alert. </b>[NOTE]:
I’m aware that this could be improved, ideally I want to prepend a <span class="emphasis"><em>=</em></span>
to the first word instead of relying on the fact the inbox will always
be the first work back.</p>
<p>The above comand basically lists all the files in the <code class="literal">~/Mail</code> directory
and adds them to a list and finally appends <span class="emphasis"><em>=</em></span> to each inbox. This way
I don’t have to worry about new inboxes being created and having to keep
track of them. I sinply have to create a new procmail recipe and let
mutt work out where the new inboxes are stored :)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now that I have a semi decent mutt setup I’d like to setup multiple SMTP
servers. It’d be cool if mutt could be configured so that I could send a reply
and the correct SMTP server is used, along with the right response header.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a id="_adding_multiple_smtp_accounts"></a>Adding multiple SMTP accounts</h4></div></div></div>
<p>So I have my personal email accounts setup, so now I can read all my emails and
filter them pretty easily. The only thing missing here is being able to respond
to emails with the correct email address.</p>
<p>So the problem at the moment is that all emails I send are set to my username
and machines hostname (<a class="ulink" href="mailto:my.username@my.machines.name.com" target="_top">my.username@my.machines.name.com</a>), which is obviously
what I want, I need to update mutt so that it can tell which email address to
use as the sender.</p>
<p>This requires quite a bit of setup so I’ll hold of on doing the actual setup
and work out what I actually need to do to all me to choose which account to
send emails.</p>
<p>The first thing I’ll need to do is make sure that the <span class="emphasis"><em>From</em></span> field in my email
responses are not that of the local machine. This should actually be the email
address that the email was sent to.</p>
<p>I’m not quite sure how to do this yet so I’ll put a fork in it for the moment
so that I can focus on getting the rest of my setup functional.</p>

<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a id="_day_13"></a>Day 13</h3></div></div></div>
<p>I’d like to organise my RSS feeds into mutt or an alternative news reader so
that I can easily keep up with current tech. Today I’ll dedicate some time into
getting this setup.</p>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a id="_getting_a_feed_reader"></a>Getting a feed reader</h4></div></div></div>
<p>So the next step along this journey is to setup a news reader. I’ve looked at a
few that I used to use in the past.</p>
<p>I stumbled on <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/posativ/homebrew-newsbeuter" target="_top">newsbeuter</a> which
is a cli with a mutt feel. Ideal for me as I’m an avid mutt user.</p>
<p>Unfortunately brew can’t find newsbeuter by it’s self so I needed to tell it
where it is and then install it on my system.</p>
<pre class="literallayout">brew tap posativ/homebrew-newsbeuter</pre>
<p>This installs the brew formula needed to install newsbeuter. Once this was complete all I had to do is run:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">brew install newsbeuter</pre>
<p>Again I had to wait, this time for newsbeuter to install, and then I was ready
to play with newsbeuter.</p>
<p>I use GoogleReader for all my RSS feeds so I needed the following in my
<code class="literal">~/.newsbeuter/config</code> file.</p>
<pre class="literallayout">urls-source "googlereader"
googlereader-login "your-googlereader-account"</pre>
<p>I also wanted to be able to share and star articles so I also added the following mappings</p>
<pre class="literallayout">googlereader-flag-share "a"
googlereader-flag-star "b"</pre>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
<p>Need a way to not have to disclose my google user id.</p>
</div>
<p>Once I started <code class="literal">newsbeuter</code> I had an empty list of feeds that I have subscribed
to in the past. The only thing left for me to do was to press <span class="emphasis"><em>R</em></span> and wait for
all of my feeds to update :)</p>
<p>Navigating through feeds is similar to vi but I’d like to actually have the
basic bindings in place so that I don’t have to keep changing context.</p>
<p>It would also be cool if I could tweak the layout so that it looked more like
my mutt setup. I’m not sure on how easy this but I’ll look into this and see
how easy it is to achieve.</p>
<p>It’s important to be able to view links easily, I’ll continue to use w3m as my
browser of choice as it is already configured and working pretty well.
newsbeuter also has podcast support :) so I can keep up to date with my
podcasts without having to rely on itunes.</p>
<p>In my <code class="literal">~/.newsbeuter/config</code> file I added the following:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">browser w3m</pre>
<p>Now that is setup I can easily open links by proving the number associated to
the link of interest.</p>

<p>So the final step in add a newsreader to my workbench is actually attaching a
window to my workbench so that I can easily view my news feed at my own
leisure.</p>
<p>The first thing to do is add a new window to my workbench config</p>
<pre class="literallayout">"Newsfeed": newsbeuter</pre>

<h3 class="title">Note</h3>

<p>I then kill my session and restart it again and I now have a separate session
to view my newsfeed.</p>

<p>Braid is causing me hassle and as part of cleaning up my dotvim files I want to
replace braid with git submodule. This will be part of the cleanup needed for
dotvim files in preparation of me improving my vim skills.</p>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a id="_removing_vims_braid"></a>Removing VIMs braid</h4></div></div></div>
<p>So I’ve been using braid to manage my vim plugins but I’d prefer if I used git
directly as I am with my dotfiles. The first thing to do is keep a list of all
of the plugins that I have, I’ll need this so that I can keep the plugins I am
currently using.</p>
<p>I’ll be using the following command to add each plugin as a git module:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">git submodule add git://github.com/username/project.git plugin/path</pre>
<p>All but one of the plugins live in the <code class="literal">bundle</code> direction the only exception is
vim-pathogen with lives in the parent directory of my dotvim repository. So the
command I need should output the following formats</p>

<p>This is enough to work with for the moment, I can easily do set this up so that
I don’t have to manually add each plugin using git submodule. I need the
following format to successfully add each plugin using git.</p>
<pre class="literallayout">git submodule add git://github.com/username/project.git plugin/path</pre>
<p>Running the following command gives me the output I want:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">cat .braids | grep 'url' | sed 's/url://' | awk -F/ '{print $0, $5}' &gt; ~/vim-plugins.txt</pre>
<p>Now that I have a list of repos that I will want to add as submodules. With a
little vim trickery I can whip and basic bash script to automatically add my
plugins.</p>
<pre class="literallayout">vi ~/vim-plugins.txt</pre>
<p>I normal mode I type the following:
  V38j
  :'&lt;,'&gt;normal f i bundle/
  :%s/bundle\ //bundle\//g</p>
<p>This will prefix bundle/ to all lines, but the last, to the 2 column.
vim-pathogen is saved to the parent directory.</p>
<pre class="literallayout">:'&lt;,'&gt;normal I git submodule add</pre>
<p>Now I have the necessary list and location for all my plugins. I’d like to
reverse the list to make sure that pathogen gets install first.</p>
<pre class="literallayout">awk '{x[NR] = $0} END { while ( NR &gt; 0 ) print x[NR--] }' vim-plugins.txt &gt; plugins.txt &amp;&amp; vim-plugins.txt</pre>
<p>This will use awk to reverse my plugin list as I wanted. Now it’s time to
remove all the plugins via braid. Then I can then add my plugins again using
git’s submodules.</p>
<pre class="literallayout">cat .braids | grep ': $' | sed 's/://' &gt; ~/plugins.txt | for plugin in `xargs`; do; rm -rf $plugin; done</pre>
<p>The above command creates the output needed to remove all of my plugins that
were installed via braid.</p>
<p>Finally I just have to execute the script I created that will add all my
plugins using <code class="literal">git submodule</code>.</p>
<p>Once this was done all I had to do is comit my changes and pull them in and I
have no more need for braid anymore.</p>

<p>Now I have a list of the plugins I had from when I was using braid. Now I’ll
use this list to reinstall my plugins and get my dotfiles up to date.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of all my plugins that I currently have installed.</p>

<p>Later on I will focus on these plugins and learn and use them better. Ideally I should
have a clean slate to improve my vi foo. For the moment though I will just add
them using git submodule and deal with stripping them down later.</p>

<p>So I now have a news reader so the only thing left to setup are my podcasts.
I’ve been using itunes of late and would like to move away from that and see
what newsbeuter has to offer in the way of helping me to keep up with podcasts.</p>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a id="_managing_my_podcasts"></a>Managing my podcasts</h4></div></div></div>
<p>Now is the time that I move my podcasts from iTunes back to the console, where
they belong. I’ve already installed newsbeuter so I can use that to track the
podcasts I listen to and handling queuing and downloading them.</p>
<p>This is pretty simple really, first off I needed to add a podcasts to my feed
list. I then checkout any new items via newsbeuter which picked up the podcast
and listed it as expected. The next step is to queue up the latest podcast and
listen to it via podbeuter. Pressing <code class="literal">e</code> enqueues the podcast which will add
the podcast to the queue for downloading. Opening <code class="literal">podbeuter</code> showed me the
podcast in the queue allowing me to press <code class="literal">a</code> to start the download.</p>
<p>Here’s the changes I needed to get podbeuter to download and listen to my
podcasts.</p>
<pre class="literallayout">download-path       ~/Downloads
max-downloads       2
player              afplay</pre>
<p>Pressing <code class="literal">p</code> inside podbeuter actually plays the selected audio file and then
we’re away. Podcast management from the command line :).</p>

<p>As this has been described in previous entries this part is straight forward
and only requires a reference to my <code class="literal">~/tmuxinator/workbench.yml</code> file. I simply
add a new <span class="emphasis"><em>Podcast</em></span> window next to my <span class="emphasis"><em>Newsfeed</em></span> window. Keeping all my
communications close together.</p>
<p></p>

<a id="_splitting_my_workbench"></a>Splitting my workbench</h4></div></div></div>
<p>My workbench is starting to get cluttered now and it is becoming increasingly
clear that I have two types of workflow living in the same session. Ideally I’d
like to have my commucation based workflows in a single session whilst my
workbench and hacking session is in another.</p>
<p>this is pretty easy, the only thing I raelly need to think about is how these
two sessions will be started.</p>
<p>Firstly I remove the  communications related sessions into a new tmux configure
file as follows:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">project_name: comms
project_root: ~/
rvm: 1.9.2-head@global
pre: cd ~/ &amp;&amp; bundle
tabs:
  - Interwepts: w3m http://google.com
  - IRC: irssi
  - "Newsfeed": newsbeuter
  - "Podcasts": podbeuter
  - Email: mutt
  - Spyhole: tail -f ~/comms.log
  - "Dotfile Diaries": cd ~/Documents/Diary &amp;&amp; vi book/book.asc
  - Top: top</pre>
<p>This leaves me with the following <span class="emphasis"><em>workbench</em></span> setup:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">project_name: workbench
project_root: ~/
rvm: 1.9.2-head@global
pre: cd ~/ &amp;&amp; bundle
tabs:
  - Workbench: vim
  - Spyhole: tail -f ~/workbench.log
  - Toybox: be pry
  - 'Control centre': git wtf</pre>
<p>I now have two separate sessions to deal with my main two workflows further
helping me to keep my workflows focussed and without switching context too
much. Now I need to make sure that I can load these two sessions easily whilst
keeping their session location in guessable positions.</p>
<p>All I need to do is add the following to my <code class="literal">.zlogin</code> file:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">mux comms &amp;&amp; mux workbench</pre>
<p>This will automatically start both sessions as soon as I start a zsh session.
This could be moved to <code class="literal">.profile</code> if needed but for the moment I won’t worry
too much about that as I tend to use zsh more than anything else.</p>
<p>Once this is done I make sure that I only start iTerm with a default session
and let <code class="literal">.zlogin</code> do the rest of the work.</p>
