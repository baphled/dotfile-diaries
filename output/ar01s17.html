I’ve been using itunes of late and would like to move away from that and see
what newsbeuter has to offer in the way of helping me to keep up with podcasts.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_managing_my_podcasts"/>Managing my podcasts</h3></div></div></div><p>Now is the time that I move my podcasts from iTunes back to the console, where
they belong. I’ve already installed newsbeuter so I can use that to track the
podcasts I listen to and handling queuing and downloading them.</p><p>This is pretty simple really, first off I needed to add a podcasts to my feed
list. I then checkout any new items via newsbeuter which picked up the podcast
and listed it as expected. The next step is to queue up the latest podcast and
listen to it via podbeuter. Pressing <code class="literal">e</code> enqueues the podcast which will add
the podcast to the queue for downloading. Opening <code class="literal">podbeuter</code> showed me the
podcast in the queue allowing me to press <code class="literal">a</code> to start the download.</p><p>Here’s the changes I needed to get podbeuter to download and listen to my
podcasts.</p><pre class="literallayout">download-path       ~/Downloads
max-downloads       2
player              afplay</pre><p>Pressing <code class="literal">p</code> inside podbeuter actually plays the selected audio file and then
we’re away. Podcast management from the command line :).</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_adding_podbeuter_to_my_workflow"/>Adding podbeuter to my workflow</h4></div></div></div><p>As this has been described in previous entries this part is straight forward
and only requires a reference to my <code class="literal">~/tmuxinator/workbench.yml</code> file. I simply
add a new <span class="emphasis"><em>Podcast</em></span> window next to my <span class="emphasis"><em>Newsfeed</em></span> window. Keeping all my
communications close together.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_splitting_my_workbench"/>Splitting my workbench</h3></div></div></div><p>My workbench is starting to get cluttered now and it is becoming increasingly
clear that I have two types of workflow living in the same session. Ideally I’d
like to have my commucation based workflows in a single session whilst my
workbench and hacking session is in another.</p><p>this is pretty easy, the only thing I raelly need to think about is how these
two sessions will be started.</p><p>Firstly I remove the  communications related sessions into a new tmux configure
file as follows:</p><pre class="literallayout">project_name: comms
project_root: ~/
rvm: 1.9.2-head@global
pre: cd ~/ &amp;&amp; bundle
tabs:
  - Interwepts: w3m http://google.com
  - IRC: irssi
  - "Newsfeed": newsbeuter
  - "Podcasts": podbeuter
  - Email: mutt
  - Spyhole: tail -f ~/comms.log
  - "Dotfile Diaries": cd ~/Documents/Diary &amp;&amp; vi book/book.asc
  - Top: top</pre><p>This leaves me with the following <span class="emphasis"><em>workbench</em></span> setup:</p><pre class="literallayout">project_name: workbench
project_root: ~/
rvm: 1.9.2-head@global
pre: cd ~/ &amp;&amp; bundle
tabs:
  - Workbench: vim
  - Spyhole: tail -f ~/workbench.log
  - Toybox: be pry
  - 'Control centre': git wtf</pre><p>I now have two separate sessions to deal with my main two workflows further
helping me to keep my workflows focussed and without switching context too
much. Now I need to make sure that I can load these two sessions easily whilst
keeping their session location in guessable positions.</p><p>All I need to do is add the following to my <code class="literal">.zlogin</code> file:</p><pre class="literallayout">mux comms &amp;&amp; mux workbench</pre><p>This will automatically start both sessions as soon as I start a zsh session.
This could be moved to <code class="literal">.profile</code> if needed but for the moment I won’t worry
too much about that as I tend to use zsh more than anything else.</p><p>Once this is done I make sure that I only start iTerm with a default session
and let <code class="literal">.zlogin</code> do the rest of the work.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s16.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s18.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Day 14 </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Housekeeping tools</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
