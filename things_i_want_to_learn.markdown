Things I want to learn
======================

I need to improve the understanding of Bash and make more use of the Linux
utility commands (ack, sed, xargs) Improve my productivity with Vim.

Move most of my workflow to the console.
----------------------------------------

Pretty much most of my work can be done via the terminal. To help reduce
context swtiching, I'd prefer to have a setup that allows to to stick to the
terminal and alert me when information (emails, tweets, etc) is coming in
