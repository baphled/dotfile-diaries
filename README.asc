== Dotfile Diaries

A day by day diary of my meanderings with my dotfiles.

The idea here is to document the changes I make to my dotfiles on a
daily basis to help me tweak my productivity whilst working in the
terminal.

This will be an on going process and will help me keep track of the
things I have learnt and as well as how I have improved my console fu
over the course of time.

There is no end to this diary, there is no real end to this diary so the
size of it may well become quite substantial. I'm not sure what I'll do
in that regard and will shelve that decision for when I have gone over
90 days or so.

This diary, although written in that way, will not actually be a daily
account of what I have done but based on the collective days I have
spent focusing on tweaking my workflow.

The notes in the appendix will gradually be rewritten as entries or
moved into the specific entry when neccessary. So over time the entries
may well be tweak for readability and clarity sake.

Other are more than welcome to add notes and tips to my diary and they 
can request entries theirselves (as paying customers).
